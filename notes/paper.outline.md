## Sections

Problem and Solutions

1. P: Data problem in systems biology and metabolic engineering S: Torchcell, Neo4j, Biocypher
2. P: DCell visible neural network (Fitness) S: One Hot set net (Fitness)  
3. P: DCell (interactions) S:  DiffPool (interactions) - Compare ontology to learned clustering. Interpretability.
