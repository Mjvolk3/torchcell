## 2025.03.22 - IGB Singularity Container

Get rocky linux image. We use Rocky Linux as it is essentially open source CentOS. And open source is obviously king ðŸ‘‘.

Apptainer used to be called singularity. We don't have updated Apptainer on IGB.

```bash
module load singularity
```

```bash
singularity pull docker://docker.io/library/rockylinux:9
```

We don't have to bind anything additionally on `igb` since everything is in default bound `$HOME`.

```bash
singularity shell --nv rockylinux_9.sif
```

We can source the same env used on machine. This is nice because we don't need to reinstall software and now we can avoid outdated `GLIBC` error.

```bash
source $HOME/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda activate torchcell
```
