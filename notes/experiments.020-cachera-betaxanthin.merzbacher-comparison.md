## 2026.07.27 — Read this before quoting any comparison number

Note crumbs so the head-to-head can be run cold. The protocol is fixed **before** we have a
model, so it is not chosen after seeing our number.

### What their deposit gives us — far more than the paper implies

The manuscript reports no split and an inconsistent test N (Fig 4b 659, Table S6 649, 20 % of
811 = 162). The Zenodo **code** deposit (10.5281/zenodo.15518666 → record 15761895) has:

| file | what it gives us |
| --- | --- |
| `data/yeast_production_test_split.csv` | the exact 640-ORF test set |
| `data/yeast_production_validation_split.csv` | same genes + released `label` 0/1/2 + CV `fold` |
| `training/yeast_training_production.py` | the exact binning rule |
| `figures/fig4/fig4b.csv` | per-fold accuracy, macro-F1, **MCC**, class-2 accuracy |
| `figures/fig4/fig4c_*.csv` | **per-gene, per-flux-sample predictions + class scores** |

Only the 49 MB code archive is mirrored; `data.zip` is 23 GB of flux samples we do not need.

### THEIR TRUE BASELINE — from their own shipped predictions

Aggregated to gene level by majority vote over each deletion's flux samples, exactly as their
`tools/knockout_voting.py` does. Best model, `RandomForestClassifier_Resampled`:

| true ↓ / pred → | low | **medium** | high |
| --- | --: | --: | --: |
| low (109) | 6 | **101** | 2 |
| medium (431) | 2 | **424** | 5 |
| high (100) | 0 | **82** | 18 |

- gene-level accuracy **0.700**, majority-class rate **0.673**
- **607 of 640 genes called medium — 94.8 %**
- **18 of 100 high producers found**
- majority predictor gets 431/640; theirs gets 448/640. **The entire margin is 17 genes.**

**They computed MCC and did not report it.** From `fig4b.csv`:

| model | accuracy | MCC | high-producer acc |
| --- | --: | --: | --: |
| RandomForest | 0.698 | **0.232** | 0.181 |
| RandomForest_Balanced | 0.698 | 0.233 | 0.117 |
| LogisticRegression | 0.515 | **0.041** | 0.233 |
| LinearSVC_Resampled | 0.445 | **0.031** | 0.273 |

MCC 0.23 is weak but **not zero** — there is real signal, concentrated in the majority class.
Be fair in any writeup: they claim "promising accuracy", not a significant gain.

**The decisive structural point:** every model that finds more high producers has *worse*
overall accuracy, because the only way to call more highs is to stop calling everything
medium. **Accuracy actively selects against the capability the task is about.**

### The recipe, fixed in advance

1. **Ground truth = THEIR RELEASED LABELS**, never labels we re-derive. Their rule min-max
   scales to [0,1] then cuts at 0.40 / 0.65, so the cuts depend on the observed extremes.
   Applied to our (larger) copy of the same screen it gives 107/476/56 against their
   109/431/100 — 81.2 % agreement, and **we call barely half as many high producers**. Same
   rule, same screen, different classes. Re-deriving would compare different tasks.
2. **Bin OUR predictions with thresholds fitted on the TRAIN split only.** Fitting on test
   leaks the class distribution, which on a 67 %-majority problem is most of the answer.
3. **Primary metrics are imbalance-immune**: Spearman, and top-*k* enrichment on high
   producers. Report **MCC** next to accuracy — they had it, so we should show it.
4. **Also report accuracy + per-class + high-producer recall**, so the comparison lands on
   their terms too.
5. **State the fraction of genes we call medium.** If ours is also ~95 %, we reproduced their
   failure mode rather than beat it, and must say so.

### Reconciliations to carry into any writeup — report, never resolve silently

- **639 of 640** of their test genes are in our test split. The one missing is `YBR011C` =
  **IPP1**, which is **essential** ([SGD S000000215](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000000215),
  null inviable). No haploid deletion collection contains *ipp1Δ*, so no screen could have
  measured it — **their test set contains a gene with no possible deletion phenotype.**
- **`PPA1` is an alias of both IPP1 and VMA16.** The screen has ONE `PPA1` row; their split
  has BOTH YBR011C and YHR026W as separate test genes. At least one of their test entries
  plausibly carries **VMA16's** value scored as if it were IPP1. Our screen-local
  disambiguation (`PPA1`→VMA16, `FEN1`→ELO2) is documented in the split builder, with the
  reasoning recorded so it can be re-derived if its premises change.
- **640 vs the paper's 811** — a 171-gene gap the Methods do not count ("sampling failed to
  converge").
- **Their validation folds appear drawn from the same 640 genes as their test list**
  (`yeast_training_production.py:124-143`), which would mean model selection touched test
  data. FLAGGED, not claimed — confirming needs `yeast_single_knockouts.npz` from the 23 GB
  archive.
- Our Cachera build is **stale** w.r.t. the name resolver (issue #195). The split is built
  from the RAW screen + resolver so it does not inherit that, but **training data still
  will** until a rebuild.

### What we can report that they cannot

- **Regression at all.** They tried and abandoned it — *"challenging with the limited number
  of knockouts at the high and low ends."* Our betaxanthin noise ceiling is **r = 0.914**
  (reliability 0.836, median 15 replicates), so regression is available to us.
- **The ~3,900 non-metabolic deletions.** FCL has no flux cone for a gene outside Yeast9, so
  it cannot make a prediction at all. We predict all ~4,700. That is a category difference,
  not a tie-break.

### Where our model stood when the sweeps were paused

`020-cachera-betaxanthin`, study `betaxanthin_002`, 33/40 trials before cancellation:
**val Pearson 0.430** — 47 % of the 0.914 ceiling — with `prot_T5_all` / learnable **False** /
`crps` / L=2 / hidden 90 / λ 6.5e-5 / decayed / yeo-johnson. The top-5 configs agreed closely,
so it is a plateau rather than a lucky trial. Companion arms: `021-ozaydin-beta-carotene`
(Spearman 0.223) and `022-mulleder-metabolome` (0.180, up from a historical ≤ 0.025).

## 2026.08.01 - Head-to-head panels on their 639 test genes

Generated by `experiments/020-cachera-betaxanthin/scripts/plot_merzbacher_comparison.py`
from the 10 finished Delta `020_v4` cells (`$DATA_ROOT/test-predictions/`) plus their
shipped `figures/fig4/fig4c_*.csv`. Scored on the 639 genes carrying their label, our
prediction, and a raw screen value (their 640th, IPP1/YBR011C, is essential -- no deletion
strain exists).

**The headline: accuracy above the majority line is the conservative-majority strategy, not
discrimination.** Their RandomForest reaches 0.700 against a 0.674 majority rate by calling
95% of genes medium; our absolute-binned cells sit at 0.674 by doing the same thing. Force
both sides to the true class marginal and every model lands at 0.50-0.57.

**Under matched binning we are indistinguishable from their best model.** Their RF 0.556 vs
our val-selected cell 0.549, and high-producer recall is 0.29 for BOTH. Yet the two models
are not making the same predictions -- their gene-level score correlates with ours at only
r = 0.108, and the two rank-binned label vectors agree on 52% of genes. Two differently-wrong
models of equal strength, which is what makes an ensemble worth testing.

The focus cell is selected by VALIDATION (`s09_L6_maskon_lr0.0001_yj`, val pearson 0.3639),
never by its score on their test genes.

### a. Gene-level accuracy -- their Fig 4b analogue

![](assets/images/020-cachera-betaxanthin/merzbacher_cmp_a_accuracy_2026-08-01-21-55-38.svg)

### b. Predicted class distribution -- the shared failure mode

![](assets/images/020-cachera-betaxanthin/merzbacher_cmp_b_class_distribution_2026-08-01-21-55-38.svg)

Their RF calls 95% medium; our absolute binning calls 94% medium and **never calls a single
gene low** (0.02 is rounding on 2 genes). Rank-matching restores the true marginal by
construction.

### c. Per-class recall -- what one accuracy number hides

![](assets/images/020-cachera-betaxanthin/merzbacher_cmp_c_per_class_recall_2026-08-01-21-55-38.svg)

Our rank-matched cell has the best high-producer recall of the four (0.29 vs their 0.18) and
the best low recall (0.20 vs their 0.06), paid for with medium recall (0.70 vs their 0.98).
That is the trade their own caption concedes but their Fig 4b cannot show.

### d. Confusion matrices, BOTH sides rank-matched -- apples-to-apples

![](assets/images/020-cachera-betaxanthin/merzbacher_cmp_d_confusion_rank_matched_2026-08-01-21-55-38.svg)

Their side is re-binned from `E[class] = p_med + 2*p_high` averaged over each gene's flux
samples, by the same rule applied to ours, so neither model keeps the majority-class
advantage and neither gets a marginal the other lacks.

**Caveat on MCC.** The 0.205 quoted elsewhere is their PER-FLUX-SAMPLE MCC; they never
published a gene-level MCC. Accuracy and high-producer recall are gene-level on both sides
and are the clean comparisons.
