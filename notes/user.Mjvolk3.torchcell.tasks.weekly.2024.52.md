## 2024.12.22

- [x] Implement dist loss.

## 2024.12.23

 ⏰ One thing today: Metabolism Label Split Regression Run

- [x] Edit regression sweep accounting for dist loss. → need to check on `GH` first
- [x] Add genome. → We have genome with hypergraph
- [ ]

- [ ] Implement intact and pert phenotype processor.

- [ ] Synthesize Results in report. Discussion on consideration of use alternative methods like mse plus a divergence measure.


- [ ] Run metabolism label split regression run


- [ ] Launch one dist loss sweep on delta

***

- [ ] Information Diff., WL Kernel

## Notes Related to Dango

- [ ] Verify

> Pearson correlation between the trigenic interaction scores of two individual replicates is around 0.59, which is much lower than the Pearson correlation between the digenic interaction score of two replicates from the same data source (0.88). ([Zhang et al., 2020, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/PJFDVT8Y)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AFBC5E89?page=3&annotation=D8D949VF))

- [ ] Plot P-Values of current dataset to compare to predicted interactions. Can do for both digenic and trigenic interactions. Do this over queried datasets.

- [ ] What is purpose of the pretraining portion? Why not just take embeddings and put into this hypergraph embedding portion?
