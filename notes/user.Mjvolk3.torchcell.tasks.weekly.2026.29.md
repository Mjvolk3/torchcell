- [x] Fixed the SI classical-ML MSE table running off the page; the overflow traced to two diverged SVR fits rather than styling, and all three benchmark tables now fit the real journal column width [[experiments.smf-dmf-tmf-001.traditional_ml-summary_table]]
- [x] Added a Pearson SI table so the correlations quoted in Supplementary Note 6 can be checked against the data [[experiments.smf-dmf-tmf-001.traditional_ml-summary_table]]
- [ ] Re-examine the SVR interaction fits at random (d=1000), where a CV s.d. of 0.383 against a mean of 0.458 sits in the same cell that produced a diverged MSE #medium [[experiments.smf-dmf-tmf-001.traditional_ml-summary_table]]
