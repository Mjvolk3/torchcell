## 2024.10.31

- [x] Implement early diffpool join to try and get some speed up. I suspect this should at least `1.5x` our speeds â†’ waited on this... â†’ timeline is messed up but went to gin `diffpool`
- [x] In `diffpool` make sure model saving is happening according to the `data root`
- [x] Check that the metrics are being recorded properly... we have some nans specifically in gene interactions â†’ added nan tolerant

## 2024.11.03

- [x] Implement GIN cell diff pool
- [x] Diffpool early metrics â†’ delayed
- [x] See how many isolated nodes we have in graphs. [[Cell_diffpool_dense|dendron://torchcell/experiments.003-fit-int.scripts.cell_diffpool_dense]] â†’ I thought this might be causing the issues with little to no learning.
- ðŸ”² Change `{hostname_slurm_job_id}_{group}` to just `{group}` since it already contains hostname.
