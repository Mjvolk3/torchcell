## Pytorch Lightning Compatibility with Pydantic

```bash
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
lightly 1.4.15 requires pydantic<2,>=1.10.5, but you have pydantic 2.1.1 which is incompatible.
lightning 2.0.6 requires pydantic<2.1.0,>=1.7.4, but you have pydantic 2.1.1 which is incompatible.
```
