Double check are we 

- [ ] Logging Umaps for $z_i$ an $z_p$ each overlaid with labels - 4 plots
- [ ] Distribution matching 
- [ ] Correlation plots
- [ ] Doing for train, val, test. For train and val on last epoch. 
- [ ] Adhering to `plot_sample_ceiling` to keep computation faster when plotting.
- [ ] Wandb should have
