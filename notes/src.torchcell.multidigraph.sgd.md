## Yeastmine Data Comparison to SGD Backend API

Does the yeastmined data have the pvalues and the sga interaction scores? Looks like for trigenic they are contained in a "note" field... you've got to be kidding me... populated in a "note" field... and for they don't look populated for digenic.... they are populated for Costanzo 2016 in an "alleles" field, but they are not populated for 2010... This data for networks is probably better pulled from the original data, but then there is potential confliction `MultiDiGraph` and experiments.
