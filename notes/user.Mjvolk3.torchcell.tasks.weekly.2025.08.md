üèÜ - `HeteroCell` Random grid 20 epochs each, small model, `lambda` loss search, `weight_decay`, norms, `num_layers`, 2 layer mlp

- [x] `HeteroCell` make trainable
- [x] `HeteroCell` validate plotting and logging
- [x] `HeteroCell` log metric to determine degeneracy in node embeddings. e.g. #oversmoothing  ‚Üí  #oversquashing more difficult as you need adjacency information and it is less likely that this is a huge issue during training. We should be able to compute it over the graph prior to training. This will be a nice characterization of potential issues with graphs and could give good justification for expander edges.
