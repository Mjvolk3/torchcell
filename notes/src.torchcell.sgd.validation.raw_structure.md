## "YPR201W" Structure Graph

## Raw Structure Plan

- Plot the raw structure of the data hierarchy with list of primitive types as leaf nodes for a gene. The intermediate data will be `json`.
- Visualized one genes graph.
- Eventually we can join all json files by appending different data types to the leaf node list of primitives or adding new key values pairs if there are new entries. It is this combination of data that ultimately defines the incoming data structure that [[python.lib.pydantic]] will validate and transform for later processing.
