## 2025.11.24

- [x] Graph regularization logging
- [x] Transformer diagnostics logging

## 2025.11.25

- [x] Launch experiments IGB
- [ ] Launch experiments Delta → Did not have `geomloss`, try again →
- [ ]

***

- [ ] Fix graphics for metabolic overlays.
- [ ] Git clean up
- [ ] Profile training on `GH` - Can also try alternate encoding if subgraphing is the issue. → [[Troubleshoot Gpu Utilization|dendron://torchcell/experiments.006.hetero-cell-bipartite-dango-gi.troubleshoot-gpu-utilization]]
- [ ] Review comparison of `String` - Why are Dango models training slowest on String 11?
- [ ]
- [ ] Twist API access submission
- [ ] Rerun query and check labels for `007`... Need to rebuild db for this
- [ ] Check morphology backups
- [ ] Move this into box /Users/michaelvolk/Documents/projects/torchcell/data/host/kuzmin2018/aao1729_data_s1.zip

***

- [ ] For @Junyu-Chen consider reconstructing $S$? Separate the metabolic graph construction process into building both $S$ then casting to a graph... Does this change properties of S? You are changing the constrains but also changing the dimensionality of the matrix... → don't know about this... I think the the constrained based optimization won't be affected from the topological change much. It is mostly a useful abstraction for propagating genes deletions.
- [ ] #ramble Need to start dumping important experimental results into the experiments folder under `/experiments` - Do this for `004-dmi-tmi` that does not work
- [ ] Add concern about graph connectivity to [[Report 003-fit-int.2025.03.03|dendron://torchcell/experiments.003-fit-int.2025.03.03]]
- [ ] Export and `rsync` this to linked delta drive
- [ ] Mount drive and spin up database. Check if database is available on ports and over http.
- [ ] Inquiry about web address for database.
- [ ] Export and `rsync` this to linked delta drive
- [ ] Mount drive and spin up database. Check if database is available on ports and over http.
- [ ] HeteroCell on String 12.0
- [ ] Contrastive DCell head on HeteroCell.
- [ ] Morphology Random Forest Baseline
- [ ] Morphology animation ? for fun...
