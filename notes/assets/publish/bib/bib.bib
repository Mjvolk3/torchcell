  abstract = {Human cancers comprise an heterogeneous array of diseases with different progression patterns and responses to therapy. However, they all develop within a host context that constrains their natural history. Since it occurs across the diversity of organisms, one can conjecture that there is order in the cancer multiverse. Is there a way to capture the broad range of tumor types within a space of the possible? Here we define the oncospace, a coordinate system that integrates the ecological, evolutionary and developmental components of cancer complexity. The spatial position of a tumor results from its departure from the healthy tissue along these three axes, and progression trajectories inform about the components driving malignancy across cancer subtypes. We postulate that the oncospace topology encodes new information regarding tumorigenic pathways, subtype prognosis, and therapeutic opportunities: treatment design could benefit from considering how to nudge tumors toward empty evolutionary dead ends in the oncospace.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) revolutionize machine learning for graph-structured data, effectively capturing complex relationships. They disseminate information through interconnected nodes, but long-range interactions face challenges known as "over-squashing". This survey delves into the challenge of over-squashing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where long-range information dissemination is hindered, impacting tasks reliant on intricate long-distance interactions. It comprehensively explores the causes, consequences, and mitigation strategies for over-squashing. Various methodologies are reviewed, including graph rewiring, novel normalization, spectral analysis, and curvature-based strategies, with a focus on their trade-offs and effectiveness. The survey also discusses the interplay between over-squashing and other GNN limitations, such as over-smoothing, and provides a taxonomy of models designed to address these issues in node and graph-level tasks. Benchmark datasets for performance evaluation are also detailed, making this survey a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the GNN field.},

  abstract = {The regulation of gene expression in response to nutrient availability is fundamental to the genotype–phenotype relationship. The metabolic–genetic make-up of the cell, as reflected in auxotrophy, is hence likely to be a determinant of gene expression. Here, we address the importance of the metabolic–genetic background by monitoring transcriptome, proteome and metabolome in a repertoire of 16 Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory backgrounds, combinatorially perturbed in histidine, leucine, methionine and uracil biosynthesis. The metabolic background affected up to 85\% of the coding genome. Suggesting widespread confounding, these transcriptional changes show, on average, 83\% overlap between unrelated auxotrophs and 35\% with previously published transcriptomes generated for non-metabolic gene knockouts. Background-dependent gene expression correlated with metabolic flux and acted, predominantly through masking or suppression, on 88\% of transcriptional interactions epistatically. As a consequence, the deletion of the same metabolic gene in a different background could provoke an entirely different transcriptional response. Propagating to the proteome and scaling up at the metabolome, metabolic background dependencies reveal the prevalence of metabolism-dependent epistasis at all regulatory levels. Urging a fundamental change of the prevailing laboratory practice of using auxotrophs and nutrient supplemented media, these results reveal epistatic intertwining of metabolism with gene expression on the genomic scale.},

These SVs primarily affect non-coding DNA sequences, but the difficulties in interpreting their impact limit our understanding of human disease etiology. The functional annotation of non-coding DNA sequences and methodologies to characterize their three-dimensional (3D) organization in the nucleus have greatly expanded our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying gene regulation, thereby improving the interpretation of SVs for their pathogenic impact. Here, we discuss the various mechanisms by which SVs can result in altered gene regulation and how these mechanisms can result in rare genetic disorders. Beyond changing gene expression, SVs can produce novel gene-intergenic fusion transcripts at the SV breakpoints.},

Most operate upstream of activation of three required stress responses (RpoS, RpoE, and SOS, key network hubs), apparently sensing stress. The results reveal how a network integrates mutagenic repair into the biology of the cell, show specific pathways of environmental sensing, demonstrate the centrality of stress responses, and imply that these responses are attractive as potential drug targets for blocking the evolution of pathogens.},

In 1998, Friedrich Cramer proposed a general resonance theory as a way forward. His theory builds on the extension of the quantum physical duality of matter and wave to the macroscopic world. According to Cramer’ theory, agents constituting biological systems oscillate, akin to musical soundwaves, at specific eigenfrequencies. Biological system dynamics can be described as “Symphonies of Life” emerging from the resonance (and dissonance) of eigenfrequencies within the interacting collective. His theory has potential for studying biological problems of increasing complexity in a fast-changing Anthropocene from a new and transdisciplinary angle. Despite data becoming increasingly available for analyses, Cramer's theory remains ignored and therefore untested a quarter century after its publication. This paper discusses how the theory can move to quantitative assessments and application. Cramer's general resonance theory deserves revival.},

We provide a thorough overview of existing literature and offer a new taxonomy of hypergraph embedding methods by identifying three main families of techniques, i.e., spectral, proximity-preserving, and (deep) neural networks. For each family, we describe its characteristics and our insights in a single yet flexible framework and then discuss the peculiarities of individual methods, as well as their pros and cons. We then review the main tasks, datasets, and settings in which hypergraph embeddings are typically used. We finally identify and discuss open challenges that would inspire further research in this field.},

This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict enhancer–promoter interactions directly from the DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of human disease associations and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution.},

It is within this context that we already developed the Biomolecular Network Ontology especially for the semantic understanding of the behaviour of complex biomolecular networks and their transittability. However, the challenge now is how to automatically populate it from a variety of biological documents. To this end, the target of this paper is to propose a new approach to automatically populate the Biomolecular Network Ontology and take advantage of the vast amount of biological knowledge expressed in heterogeneous unstructured data about complex biomolecular networks. Indeed, we have recently observed the emergence of deep learning techniques that provide significant and rapid progress in several domains, particularly in the process of deriving high-quality information from text. Despite its significant progress in recent years, deep learning is still not commonly used to populate ontologies. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based NLP ontology population system to populate the Biomolecular Network Ontology. Its originality is to jointly exploit deep learning and natural language processing techniques to identify, extract and classify new instances referring to the BNO ontology’s concepts from textual data. The preliminary results highlight the efficiency of our proposal for ontology population.},

  abstract = {Graph neural networks have been widely used on modeling graph data, achieving impressive results on node classification and link prediction tasks. Yet, obtaining an accurate representation for a graph further requires a pooling function that maps a set of node representations into a compact form. A simple sum or average over all node representations considers all node features equally without consideration of their task relevance, and any structural dependencies among them. Recently proposed hierarchical graph pooling methods, on the other hand, may yield the same representation for two different graphs that are distinguished by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, as they suboptimally preserve information from the node features. To tackle these limitations of existing graph pooling methods, we first formulate the graph pooling problem as a multiset encoding problem with auxiliary information about the graph structure, and propose a Graph Multiset Transformer (GMT) which is a multi-head attention based global pooling layer that captures the interaction between nodes according to their structural dependencies. We show that GMT satisfies both injectiveness and permutation invariance, such that it is at most as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. Moreover, our methods can be easily extended to the previous node clustering approaches for hierarchical graph pooling. Our experimental results show that GMT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification benchmarks with high memory and time efficiency, and obtains even larger performance gain on graph reconstruction and generation tasks.},

  abstract = {Recently, graph neural networks have attracted great attention and achieved prominent performance in various research fields. Most of those algorithms have assumed pairwise relationships of objects of interest. However, in many real applications, the relationships between objects are in higher-order, beyond a pairwise formulation. To efficiently learn deep embeddings on the high-order graph-structured data, we introduce two end-to-end trainable operators to the family of graph neural networks, i.e., hypergraph convolution and hypergraph attention. Whilst hypergraph convolution defines the basic formulation of performing convolution on a hypergraph, hypergraph attention further enhances the capacity of representation learning by leveraging an attention module. With the two operators, a graph neural network is readily extended to a more flexible model and applied to diverse applications where non-pairwise relationships are observed. Extensive experimental results with semi-supervised node classification demonstrate the effectiveness of hypergraph convolution and hypergraph attention.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) drive current AI breakthroughs despite very little being known about their internal representations. In this work, we propose to shed the light on LLMs inner mechanisms through the lens of geometry. In particular, we develop in closed form \$(i)\$ the intrinsic dimension in which the Multi-Head Attention embeddings are constrained to exist and \$(ii)\$ the partition and per-region affine mappings of the feedforward (MLP) network of LLMs' layers. Our theoretical findings further enable the design of novel principled solutions applicable to state-of-the-art LLMs. First, we show that, through our geometric understanding, we can bypass LLMs' RLHF protection by controlling the embedding's intrinsic dimension through informed prompt manipulation. Second, we derive interpretable geometrical features that can be extracted from any (pre-trained) LLM, providing a rich abstract representation of their inputs. We observe that these features are sufficient to help solve toxicity detection, and even allow the identification of various types of toxicity. Our results demonstrate how, even in large-scale regimes, exact theoretical results can answer practical questions in LLMs. Code: https://github.com/RandallBalestriero/SplineLLM},

  abstract = {The dominant paradigm for learning on graph-structured data is message passing. Despite being a strong inductive bias, the local message passing mechanism suffers from pathological issues such as over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited node-level expressivity. To address these limitations we propose Bundle Neural Networks (BuNN), a new type of GNN that operates via message diffusion over flat vector bundles - structures analogous to connections on Riemannian manifolds that augment the graph by assigning to each node a vector space and an orthogonal map. A BuNN layer evolves the features according to a diffusion-type partial differential equation. When discretized, BuNNs are a special case of Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs), a recently proposed MPNN capable of mitigating over-smoothing. The continuous nature of message diffusion enables BuNNs to operate on larger scales of the graph and, therefore, to mitigate over-squashing. Finally, we prove that BuNN can approximate any feature transformation over nodes on any (potentially infinite) family of graphs given injective positional encodings, resulting in universal node-level expressivity. We support our theory via synthetic experiments and showcase the strong empirical performance of BuNNs over a range of real-world tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on several standard benchmarks in transductive and inductive settings.},

  abstract = {The quality of signal propagation in message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) strongly influences their expressivity as has been observed in recent works. In particular, for prediction tasks relying on long-range interactions, recursive aggregation of node features can lead to an undesired phenomenon called “oversquashing”. We present a framework for analyzing oversquashing based on information contraction. Our analysis is guided by a model of reliable computation due to von Neumann that lends a new insight into oversquashing as signal quenching in noisy computation graphs. Building on this, we propose a graph rewiring algorithm aimed at alleviating oversquashing. Our algorithm employs a random local edge flip primitive motivated by an expander graph construction. We compare the spectral expansion properties of our algorithm with that of an existing curvature-based non-local rewiring strategy. Synthetic experiments show that while our algorithm in general has a slower rate of expansion, it is overall computationally cheaper, preserves the node degrees exactly and never disconnects the graph.},

  abstract = {The problem of model inference is of fundamental importance to systems biology. Logical models (e.g. Boolean networks; BNs) represent a computationally attractive approach capable of handling large biological networks. The models are typically inferred from experimental data. However, even with a substantial amount of experimental data supported by some prior knowledge, existing inference methods often focus on a small sample of admissible candidate models only.We propose Boolean network sketches as a new formal instrument for the inference of Boolean networks. A sketch integrates (typically partial) knowledge about the network’s topology and the update logic (obtained through, e.g. a biological knowledge base or a literature search), as well as further assumptions about the properties of the network’s transitions (e.g. the form of its attractor landscape), and additional restrictions on the model dynamics given by the measured experimental data. Our new BNs inference algorithm starts with an ‘initial’ sketch, which is extended by adding restrictions representing experimental data to a ‘data-informed’ sketch and subsequently computes all BNs consistent with the data-informed sketch. Our algorithm is based on a symbolic representation and coloured model-checking. Our approach is unique in its ability to cover a broad spectrum of knowledge and efficiently produce a compact representation of all inferred BNs. We evaluate the method on a non-trivial collection of real-world and simulated data.All software and data are freely available as a reproducible artefact at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7688740.},

  abstract = {Similarity studies are important for chemistry and their applications range from the periodic table to the screening of large databases in the searching for new drugs. In this later case, it is assumed that similarity in molecular structure is related to similarity in reactivity. However, we state that structural formulas can be regarded as abstract representations emerging from the analysis of large amounts of data upon chemical reactivity. Hence, chemical formulas such as organic functions are not direct pictures of the atomic constitution of matter, but signs used to represent similarity in the reactivity of a class of substances. Therefore, reactivity, rather than molecular structure, becomes the fundamental feature of chemical substances. As reactivity is important, chemical identity is given by the relations substances establish with each other, giving place to a network of chemical reactions. We explore similarity in the network rather than in molecular structure. By characterising each substance in terms of the related ones, we show how Category Theory helps in this description. Afterwards, we study the similarity among substances using topological spaces, which leads us to concepts such as closure and neighbourhood, which formalise the intuition of things lying somewhere near around. The second focus of the chapter is the exploration of the potential of closure operators, and of topological closures in particular, as more general descriptors of chemical similarity. As we introduce the formalism, we develop a worked example, concerning the analysis of similarity among chemical elements regarding their ability to combine into binary compounds. The results show that several of the trends of chemical elements are found through the current approach.},

While considerable attention has been devoted to analyzing the expressive power of message-passing (MP) layers in GNNs, a study on how graph pooling affects the expressiveness of a GNN is still lacking. Additionally, despite the recent advances in the design of pooling operators, there is not a principled criterion to compare them. In this work, we derive sufficient conditions for a pooling operator to fully preserve the expressive power of the MP layers before it. These conditions serve as a universal and theoretically grounded criterion for choosing among existing pooling operators or designing new ones.

  abstract = {In Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), hierarchical pooling operators generate local summaries of the data by coarsening the graph structure and the vertex features. While considerable attention has been devoted to analyzing the expressive power of message-passing (MP) layers in GNNs, a study on how graph pooling affects the expressiveness of a GNN is still lacking. Additionally, despite the recent advances in the design of pooling operators, there is not a principled criterion to compare them. In this work, we derive sufficient conditions for a pooling operator to fully preserve the expressive power of the MP layers before it. These conditions serve as a universal and theoretically grounded criterion for choosing among existing pooling operators or designing new ones. Based on our theoretical findings, we analyze several existing pooling operators and identify those that fail to satisfy the expressiveness conditions. Finally, we introduce an experimental setup to verify empirically the expressive power of a GNN equipped with pooling layers, in terms of its capability to perform a graph isomorphism test.},

  abstract = {Spectral clustering (SC) is a popular clustering technique to find strongly connected communities on a graph. SC can be used in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to implement pooling operations that aggregate nodes belonging to the same cluster. However, the eigendecomposition of the Laplacian is expensive and, since clustering results are graph-specific, pooling methods based on SC must perform a new optimization for each new sample. In this paper, we propose a graph clustering approach that addresses these limitations of SC. We formulate a continuous relaxation of the normalized minCUT problem and train a GNN to compute cluster assignments that minimize this objective. Our GNN-based implementation is differentiable, does not require to compute the spectral decomposition, and learns a clustering function that can be quickly evaluated on out-of-sample graphs. From the proposed clustering method, we design a graph pooling operator that overcomes some important limitations of state-of-the-art graph pooling techniques and achieves the best performance in several supervised and unsupervised tasks.},

For example, relying on 16S rRNA to answer questions about the function of the microbiome generates epistemic misalignments, due to the different temporal scales that 16S rRNA provides information about and the temporal scales that are required to know about the functionality of some microorganisms. We show how some of these exist in contemporary microbiome science and urge microbiome scientists to take some measures to avoid them, as they may question the credibility of the field as a whole.},

By meticulously studying model microorganisms, in particular Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, increasingly comprehensive computational models predict metabolic fluxes, protein expression, and growth. The modeling rationale is that cells are constrained by a limited pool of resources that they allocate optimally to maximize fitness. As a consequence, the expression of particular proteins is at the expense of others, causing trade-offs between cellular objectives such as instantaneous growth, stress tolerance, and capacity to adapt to new environments. While current computational models are remarkably predictive for E. coli and S. cerevisiae when grown in laboratory environments, this may not hold for other growth conditions and other microorganisms. In this contribution, we therefore discuss the relationship between the instantaneous growth rate, limited resources, and long-term fitness. We discuss uses and limitations of current computational models, in particular for rapidly changing and adverse environments, and propose to classify microbial growth strategies based on Grimes's CSR framework.},

Driven by evolutionary selection, the amino acid sequence is tailored to meet the required abundance of proteomes, underscoring the intricate relationship between sequence and functional demand. Yet, the specific role of amino acid sequences in determining proteome abundance remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the amino acid sequence predicts abundance by shaping a protein’s conformational stability. We show that increasing the abundance provides metabolic cost benefits, underscoring the evolutionary advantage of maintaining a highly abundant and stable proteome. Specifically, using a deep learning model (BERT), we predict 56\% of protein abundance variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae solely based on amino acid sequence. The model reveals latent factors linking sequence features to protein stability. To probe these relationships, we introduce MGEM (Mutation Guided by an Embedded Manifold), a methodology for guiding protein abundance through sequence modifications. We find that mutations increasing abundance significantly alter protein polarity and hydrophobicity, underscoring a connection between protein stability and abundance. Through molecular dynamics simulations and in vivo experiments in yeast, we confirm that abundance-enhancing mutations result in longer-lasting and more stable protein expression. Importantly, these sequence changes also reduce metabolic costs of protein synthesis, elucidating the evolutionary advantage of cost-effective, high-abundance, stable proteomes. Our findings support the role of amino acid sequence as a pivotal determinant of protein abundance and stability, revealing an evolutionary optimization for metabolic efficiency.},

However, concerns over their empirical effectiveness, scalability, and complexity of the pre-processing steps have been raised, especially in relation to much simpler graph neural networks that typically perform on par with them across a wide range of benchmarks. To tackle these shortcomings, we consider graphs as sets of edges and propose a purely attention-based approach consisting of an encoder and an attention pooling mechanism. The encoder vertically interleaves masked and vanilla self-attention modules to learn an effective representations of edges, while allowing for tackling possible misspecifications in input graphs. Despite its simplicity, the approach outperforms fine-tuned message passing baselines and recently proposed transformer-based methods on more than 70 node and graph-level tasks, including challenging long-range benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across different tasks, ranging from molecular to vision graphs, and heterophilous node classification. The approach also outperforms graph neural networks and transformers in transfer learning settings, and scales much better than alternatives with a similar performance level or expressive power.},

  abstract = {An effective aggregation of node features into a graph-level representation via readout functions is an essential step in numerous learning tasks involving graph neural networks. Typically, readouts are simple and non-adaptive functions designed such that the resulting hypothesis space is permutation invariant. Prior work on deep sets indicates that such readouts might require complex node embeddings that can be difficult to learn via standard neighborhood aggregation schemes. Motivated by this, we investigate the potential of adaptive readouts given by neural networks that do not necessarily give rise to permutation invariant hypothesis spaces. We argue that in some problems such as binding affinity prediction where molecules are typically presented in a canonical form it might be possible to relax the constraints on permutation invariance of the hypothesis space and learn a more effective model of the affinity by employing an adaptive readout function. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of neural readouts on more than 40 datasets spanning different domains and graph characteristics. Moreover, we observe a consistent improvement over standard readouts (i.e., sum, max, and mean) relative to the number of neighborhood aggregation iterations and different convolutional operators.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in representation learning on graphs, mainly leveraging graph convolutional networks, have brought a substantial improvement on many graph-based benchmark tasks. While novel approaches to learning node embeddings are highly suitable for node classification and link prediction, their application to graph classification (predicting a single label for the entire graph) remains mostly rudimentary, typically using a single global pooling step to aggregate node features or a hand-designed, fixed heuristic for hierarchical coarsening of the graph structure. An important step towards ameliorating this is differentiable graph coarsening---the ability to reduce the size of the graph in an adaptive, data-dependent manner within a graph neural network pipeline, analogous to image downsampling within CNNs. However, the previous prominent approach to pooling has quadratic memory requirements during training and is therefore not scalable to large graphs. Here we combine several recent advances in graph neural network design to demonstrate that competitive hierarchical graph classification results are possible without sacrificing sparsity. Our results are verified on several established graph classification benchmarks, and highlight an important direction for future research in graph-based neural networks.},

A major obstacle in integrating omics data from multiple modalities is that different omics layers typically have distinct feature spaces. Here, we propose a computational framework called GLUE (graph-linked unified embedding), which bridges the gap by modeling regulatory interactions across omics layers explicitly. Systematic benchmarking demonstrated that GLUE is more accurate, robust and scalable than state-of-the-art tools for heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics data. We applied GLUE to various challenging tasks, including triple-omics integration, integrative regulatory inference and multi-omics human cell atlas construction over millions of cells, where GLUE was able to correct previous annotations. GLUE features a modular design that can be flexibly extended and enhanced for new analysis tasks. The full package is available online at https://github.com/gao-lab/GLUE.},

  abstract = {Gene regulatory networks are composed of sub-networks that are often shared across biological processes, cell-types, and organisms. Leveraging multiple sources of information, such as publicly available gene expression datasets, could therefore be helpful when learning a network of interest. Integrating data across different studies, however, raises numerous technical concerns. Hence, a common approach in network inference, and broadly in genomics research, is to separately learn models from each dataset and combine the results. Individual models, however, often suffer from under-sampling, poor generalization and limited network recovery. In this study, we explore previous integration strategies, such as batch-correction and model ensembles, and introduce a new multitask learning approach for joint network inference across several datasets. Our method initially estimates the activities of transcription factors, and subsequently, infers the relevant network topology. As regulatory interactions are context-dependent, we estimate model coefficients as a combination of both dataset-specific and conserved components. In addition, adaptive penalties may be used to favor models that include interactions derived from multiple sources of prior knowledge including orthogonal genomics experiments. We evaluate generalization and network recovery using examples from Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and show that sharing information across models improves network reconstruction. Finally, we demonstrate robustness to both false positives in the prior information and heterogeneity among datasets.},

Due to its importance, several computational approaches have been proposed to infer gene regulatory networks from gene expression data. In this review, six inference approaches are discussed: Boolean network, probabilistic Boolean network, ordinary differential equation, neural network, Bayesian network, and dynamic Bayesian network. These approaches are discussed in terms of introduction, methodology and recent applications of these approaches in gene regulatory network construction. These approaches are also compared in the discussion section. Furthermore, the strengths and weaknesses of these computational approaches are described.},

  abstract = {The stability of mRNA is one of the major determinants of gene expression. Although a wealth of sequence elements regulating mRNA stability has been described, their quantitative contributions to half-life are unknown. Here, we built a quantitative model for Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on functional mRNA sequence features that explains 59\% of the half-life variation between genes and predicts half-life at a median relative error of 30\%. The model revealed a new destabilizing 3′ UTR motif, ATATTC, which we functionally validated. Codon usage proves to be the major determinant of mRNA stability. Nonetheless, single-nucleotide variations have the largest effect when occurring on 3′ UTR motifs or upstream AUGs. Analyzing mRNA half-life data of 34 knockout strains showed that the effect of codon usage not only requires functional decapping and deadenylation, but also the 5′ -to-3′ exonuclease Xrn1, the nonsense-mediated decay genes, but not no-go decay. Altogether, this study quantitatively delineates the contributions of mRNA sequence features on stability in yeast, reveals their functional dependencies on degradation pathways, and allows accurate prediction of half-life from mRNA sequence.},

Recently,there has been increasing interest in integrating Transformers with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance analyzing geometric properties of graphs by employing global attention mechanisms. A key challenge in improving graph transformers is enhancing their ability to distinguish between isomorphic graphs, which can potentially boost their predictive performance. To address this challenge, we introduce ’Topology-Informed Graph Transformer (TIGT)’, a novel transformer enhancing both discriminative power in detecting graph isomorphisms and the overall performance of Graph Transformers. TIGT consists of four components: (1) a topological positional embedding layer using non-isomorphic universal covers based on cyclic subgraphs of graphs to ensure unique graph representation, (2) a dual-path message-passing layer to explicitly encode topological characteristics throughout the encoder layers, (3) a global attention mechanism, and (4) a graph information layer to recalibrate channel-wise graph features for improved feature representation. TIGT outperforms previous Graph Transformers in classifying synthetic dataset aimed at distinguishing isomorphism classes of graphs. Additionally, mathematical analysis and empirical evaluations highlight our model’s competitive edge over state-of-the-art Graph Transformers across various benchmark datasets.},

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.},

  abstract = {iGraphs are flexible mathematical objects that can represent many entities and knowledge from different domains, including in the life sciences. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are mathematical models that can learn functions over graphs and are a leading approach for building predictive models on graph-structured data. This combination has enabled GNNs to advance the state of the art in many disciplines, from discovering new antibiotics and identifying drug-repurposing candidates to modelling physical systems and generating new molecules. This Primer provides a practical and accessible introduction to GNNs, describing their properties and applications to the life and physical sciences. Emphasis is placed on the practical implications of key theoretical limitations, new ideas to solve these challenges and important considerations when using GNNs on a new task.},

  abstract = {Genome sequencing projects have revealed a massive catalog of genes and astounding genetic diversity in a variety of organisms. We are now faced with the formidable challenge of assigning functions to thousands of genes, and how to use this information to understand how genes interact and coordinate cell function. Studies indicate that the majority of eukaryotic genes are dispensable, highlighting the extensive buffering of genomes against genetic and environmental perturbations. Such robustness poses a significant challenge to those seeking to understand the wiring diagram of the cell. Genome-scale screens for genetic interactions are an effective means to chart the network that underlies this functional redundancy. A complete atlas of genetic interactions offers the potential to assign functions to most genes identified by whole genome sequencing projects and to delineate a functional wiring diagram of the cell. Perhaps more importantly, mapping genetic networks on a large-scale will shed light on the general principles and rules governing genetic networks and provide valuable information regarding the important but elusive relationship between genotype and phenotype.},

Longstanding methods for peptide identification, such as search engines and experimental spectral libraries, are being superseded by deep learning models that allow the fragmentation spectra of peptides to be predicted from their amino acid sequence. These new approaches, including recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks, use predicted in silico spectral libraries rather than experimental libraries to achieve higher sensitivity and/or specificity in the analysis of proteomics data. Machine learning is galvanizing applications that involve large search spaces, such as immunopeptidomics and proteogenomics. Current challenges in the field include the prediction of spectra for peptides with post-translational modifications and for cross-linked pairs of peptides. Permeation of machine-learning-based spectral prediction into search engines and spectrum-centric data-independent acquisition workflows for diverse peptide classes and measurement conditions will continue to push sensitivity and dynamic range in proteomics applications in the coming years.},

  abstract = {Multi-task learning (MTL) is a subfield of machine learning with important applications, but the multi-objective nature of optimization in MTL leads to difficulties in balancing training between tasks. The best MTL optimization methods require individually computing the gradient of each task's loss function, which impedes scalability to a large number of tasks. In this paper, we propose Scaled Loss Approximate Weighting (SLAW), a method for multi-task optimization that matches the performance of the best existing methods while being much more efficient. SLAW balances learning between tasks by estimating the magnitudes of each task's gradient without performing any extra backward passes. We provide theoretical and empirical justification for SLAW's estimation of gradient magnitudes. Experimental results on non-linear regression, multi-task computer vision, and virtual screening for drug discovery demonstrate that SLAW is significantly more efficient than strong baselines without sacrificing performance and applicable to a diverse range of domains.},

Thanks to the decomposed formulation of DKL loss, we have identified two areas for improvement. Firstly, we address the limitation of KL/DKL in scenarios like knowledge distillation by breaking its asymmetric optimization property. This modification ensures that the \$\textbackslash mathbf\{w\}\$MSE component is always effective during training, providing extra constructive cues. Secondly, we introduce class-wise global information into KL/DKL to mitigate bias from individual samples. With these two enhancements, we derive the Improved Kullback-Leibler (IKL) Divergence loss and evaluate its effectiveness by conducting experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets, focusing on adversarial training, and knowledge distillation tasks. The proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art adversarial robustness on the public leaderboard -- RobustBench and competitive performance on knowledge distillation, demonstrating the substantial practical merits.

  abstract = {Metabolic modeling and machine learning are key components in the emerging next generation of systems and synthetic biology tools, targeting the genotype–phenotype–environment relationship. Rather than being used in isolation, it is becoming clear that their value is maximized when they are combined. However, the potential of integrating these two frameworks for omic data augmentation and integration is largely unexplored. We propose, rigorously assess, and compare machine-learning–based data integration techniques, combining gene expression profiles with computationally generated metabolic flux data to predict yeast cell growth. To this end, we create strain-specific metabolic models for 1,143               Saccharomyces cerevisiae               mutants and we test 27 machine-learning methods, incorporating state-of-the-art feature selection and multiview learning approaches. We propose a multiview neural network using fluxomic and transcriptomic data, showing that the former increases the predictive accuracy of the latter and reveals functional patterns that are not directly deducible from gene expression alone. We test the proposed neural network on a further 86 strains generated in a different experiment, therefore verifying its robustness to an additional independent dataset. Finally, we show that introducing mechanistic flux features improves the predictions also for knockout strains whose genes were not modeled in the metabolic reconstruction. Our results thus demonstrate that fusing experimental cues with in silico models, based on known biochemistry, can contribute with disjoint information toward biologically informed and interpretable machine learning. Overall, this study provides tools for understanding and manipulating complex phenotypes, increasing both the prediction accuracy and the extent of discernible mechanistic biological insights.},

  abstract = {Closing the gap between measurable genetic information and observable traits is a longstanding challenge in genomics. Yet, the prediction of molecular phenotypes from DNA sequences alone remains limited and inaccurate, often driven by the scarcity of annotated data and the inability to transfer learnings between prediction tasks. Here, we present an extensive study of foundation models pre-trained on DNA sequences, named the Nucleotide Transformer, integrating information from 3,202 diverse human genomes, as well as 850 genomes from a wide range of species, including model and non-model organisms. These transformer models yield transferable, context-specific representations of nucleotide sequences, which allow for accurate molecular phenotype prediction even in low-data settings. We show that the representations alone match or outperform specialized methods on 11 of 18 prediction tasks, and up to 15 after fine-tuning. Despite no supervision, the transformer models learnt to focus attention on key genomic elements, including those that regulate gene expression, such as enhancers. Lastly, we demonstrate that utilizing model representations alone can improve the prioritization of functional genetic variants. The training and application of foundational models in genomics explored in this study provide a widely applicable stepping stone to bridge the gap of accurate molecular phenotype prediction from DNA sequence alone.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is a previously unstudied result in the context of graph representation learning, and we believe our analysis paves the way to a novel class of scalable methods to counter oversquashing in GNNs.},

  abstract = {How transcription factors (TFs) interpret cis-regulatory DNA sequence to control gene expression remains unclear, largely because past studies using native and engineered sequences had insufficient scale. Here, we measure the expression output of {$>$}100 million synthetic yeast promoter sequences that are fully random. These sequences yield diverse, reproducible expression levels that can be explained by their chance inclusion of functional TF binding sites. We use machine learning to build interpretable models of transcriptional regulation that predict \textasciitilde 94\% of the expression driven from independent test promoters and \textasciitilde 89\% of the expression driven from native yeast promoter fragments. These models allow us to characterize each TF’s specificity, activity and interactions with chromatin. TF activity depends on binding-site strand, position, DNA helical face and chromatin context. Notably, expression level is influenced by weak regulatory interactions, which confound designed-sequence studies. Our analyses show that massive-throughput assays of fully random DNA can provide the big data necessary to develop complex, predictive models of gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Graph transformers (GTs) have emerged as a promising architecture that is theoretically more expressive than message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs). However, typical GT models have at least quadratic complexity and thus cannot scale to large graphs. While there are several linear GTs recently proposed, they still lag behind GNN counterparts on several popular graph datasets, which poses a critical concern on their practical expressivity. To balance the trade-off between expressivity and scalability of GTs, we propose Polynormer, a polynomial-expressive GT model with linear complexity. Polynormer is built upon a novel base model that learns a high-degree polynomial on input features. To enable the base model permutation equivariant, we integrate it with graph topology and node features separately, resulting in local and global equivariant attention models. Consequently, Polynormer adopts a linear local-to-global attention scheme to learn high-degree equivariant polynomials whose coefficients are controlled by attention scores. Polynormer has been evaluated on \$13\$ homophilic and heterophilic datasets, including large graphs with millions of nodes. Our extensive experiment results show that Polynormer outperforms state-of-the-art GNN and GT baselines on most datasets, even without the use of nonlinear activation functions.},

  abstract = {Graph-level anomaly detection has gained significant attention as it finds applications in various domains, such as cancer diagnosis and enzyme prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the spectral properties of graph anomalies, resulting in unexplainable framework design and unsatisfying performance. In this paper, we re-investigate the spectral differences between anomalous and normal graphs. Our main observation shows a significant disparity in the accumulated spectral energy between these two classes. Moreover, we prove that the accumulated spectral energy of the graph signal can be represented by its Rayleigh Quotient, indicating that the Rayleigh Quotient is a driving factor behind the anomalous properties of graphs. Motivated by this, we propose Rayleigh Quotient Graph Neural Network (RQGNN), the first spectral GNN that explores the inherent spectral features of anomalous graphs for graph-level anomaly detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel framework with two components: the Rayleigh Quotient learning component (RQL) and Chebyshev Wavelet GNN with RQ-pooling (CWGNN-RQ). RQL explicitly captures the Rayleigh Quotient of graphs and CWGNN-RQ implicitly explores the spectral space of graphs. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets show that RQGNN outperforms the best rival by 6.74\% in Macro-F1 score and 1.44\% in AUC, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

However, the link between the essentiality of a gene and its degree of polymorphism is unclear. In this review, we show that there is a place for a certain degree of variability, even for essential genes. We first study the role of infectious diseases in the prevalence of genetic disorders among humans: balancing selection has selected harmful variants due to the selective pressure of pathogens because the heterozygous carrier can resist them. Then we show that the environment can induce adaptation of species by rapidly evolving genes. We also study the role of positive selection on speciation, particularly upon genes of the immune, reproductive and nervous systems. Finally, we highlight the role of regulatory sequences in changes in morphology between species and adaptation to the environment within species.},

GNNs have been applied to numerous domains ranging from quantum chemistry, recommender systems to knowledge graphs and natural language processing. A major issue with arbitrary graphs is the absence of canonical positional information of nodes, which decreases the representation power of GNNs to distinguish e.g. isomorphic nodes and other graph symmetries. An approach to tackle this issue is to introduce Positional Encoding (PE) of nodes, and inject it into the input layer, like in Transformers. Possible graph PE are Laplacian eigenvectors. In this work, we propose to decouple structural and positional representations to make easy for the network to learn these two essential properties. We introduce a novel generic architecture which we call \textbackslash texttt\{LSPE\} (Learnable Structural and Positional Encodings). We investigate several sparse and fully-connected (Transformer-like) GNNs, and observe a performance increase for molecular datasets, from \$1.79\textbackslash\%\$ up to \$64.14\textbackslash\%\$ when considering learnable PE for both GNN classes.},

Here, we trained two auto-regressive models (Transformer-XL, XLNet) and four auto-encoder models (BERT, Albert, Electra, T5) on data from UniRef and BFD containing up to 393 billion amino acids. The protein LMs (pLMs) were trained on the Summit supercomputer using 5616 GPUs and TPU Pod up-to 1024 cores. Dimensionality reduction revealed that the raw pLM-embeddings from unlabeled data captured some biophysical features of protein sequences. We validated the advantage of using the embeddings as exclusive input for several subsequent tasks: (1) a per-residue (per-token) prediction of protein secondary structure (3-state accuracy Q3=81\%-87\%); (2) per-protein (pooling) predictions of protein sub-cellular location (ten-state accuracy: Q10=81\%) and membrane versus water-soluble (2-state accuracy Q2=91\%). For secondary structure, the most informative embeddings (ProtT5) for the first time outperformed the state-of-the-art without multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) or evolutionary information thereby bypassing expensive database searches.

Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) has been supporting the yeast research community since 1993, serving as its de facto hub. Over the years, SGD has maintained the genetic nomenclature, chromosome maps, and functional annotation, and developed various tools and methods for analysis and curation of a variety of emerging data types. More recently, SGD and six other model organism focused knowledgebases have come together to create the Alliance of Genome Resources to develop sustainable genome information resources that promote and support the use of various model organisms to understand the genetic and genomic bases of human biology and disease. Here we describe recent activities at SGD, including the latest reference genome annotation update, the development of a curation system for mutant alleles, and new pages addressing homology across model organisms as well as the use of yeast to study human disease.},

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA genomics technologies are revolutionizing biomedical science by profiling single cells with unprecedented resolution, providing fundamental insights into the role of different cellular states and intercellular heterogeneity in health and disease. The combination of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with metabolic RNA labelling approaches now enables time-resolved monitoring of transcriptional responses for thousands of genes in thousands of individual cells in parallel. This facilitates and accelerates direct characterization of the temporal dimension of biological processes, which has been largely missing in current data. In this Primer, we provide an overview of the various metabolic RNA labelling approaches and their combination with currently available scRNA-seq and multi-omics platforms. We summarize the main challenges in the design of such experiments and discuss the various applications of time-resolved scRNA-seq in vitro and in vivo. We outline the computational tools and challenges to the analyses of the temporal dynamics of transcriptional responses at the single-cell level. We discuss the prospect of integrating data obtained by the respective time-resolved scRNA-seq approaches with complementary methods to elucidate gene regulatory networks that underlie molecular mechanisms. Finally, we discuss open questions and challenges in the field and give our thoughts for future development and applications.},

  abstract = {The stoichiometric matrix, S, represents a mapping of reaction rate vectors into a space of concentration time derivatives. The left null space of the stoichiometric matrix contains the dynamic invariants: a combination of concentration variables, referred to as metabolic pools, whose total concentration does not change over time. By analogy to the traditional reaction map formed by S, a compound map can be derived from −ST. The analogy to flux analysis of the (right) null space of S enables us to classify the metabolic pools into three categories: Type A that contains chemical elements and their combinations in the form of certain moieties, Type B that contains such moieties in addition to cofactors carrying such moieties that are internal to the network, and Type C that contains only the cofactors. A convex formulation of the basis for the left null space allows us to directly classify the metabolic pools into these three categories. Type B metabolic pools include conservation pools that form conjugates of moiety-occupied and moiety-vacant concentration states of metabolites and cofactors. Type B metabolic pools thus describe the various states of moiety exchange between the primary substrates and the cofactors that capture properties like energy and redox potential. The convex basis gives clear insight into this exchange for glycolytic pathway in human red blood cell, including the identification of high and low energy pools that form conjugates. Examples suggest that pool maps may be more appropriate for signaling pathways than flux maps. The analysis of the left null space of the stoichiometric matrix allows us to define the achievable states of the cell and their physiological relevance.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are proposed without considering the agnostic distribution shifts between training graphs and testing graphs, inducing the degeneration of the generalization ability of GNNs in Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) settings. The fundamental reason for such degeneration is that most GNNs are developed based on the I.I.D hypothesis. In such a setting, GNNs tend to exploit subtle statistical correlations existing in the training set for predictions, even though it is a spurious correlation. This learning mechanism inherits from the common characteristics of machine learning approaches. However, such spurious correlations may change in the wild testing environments, leading to the failure of GNNs. Therefore, eliminating the impact of spurious correlations is crucial for stable GNN models. To this end, in this paper, we argue that the spurious correlation exists among subgraph-level units and analyze the degeneration of GNN in causal view. Based on the causal view analysis, we propose a general causal representation framework for stable GNN, called StableGNN. The main idea of this framework is to extract high-level representations from raw graph data first and resort to the distinguishing ability of causal inference to help the model get rid of spurious correlations. Particularly, to extract meaningful high-level representations, we exploit a differentiable graph pooling layer to extract subgraph-based representations by an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, inspired by the confounder balancing techniques from causal inference, based on the learned high-level representations, we propose a causal variable distinguishing regularizer to correct the biased training distribution by learning a set of sample weights. Hence, GNNs would concentrate more on the true connection between discriminative substructures and labels. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic datasets with various distribution shift degrees and eight real-world OOD graph datasets. The results well verify that the proposed model StableGNN not only outperforms the state-of-the-arts but also provides a flexible framework to enhance existing GNNs. In addition, the interpretability experiments validate that StableGNN could leverage causal structures for predictions.},

To provide a meaningful data summary for downstream scientific analyses, the graph similarity measures used for these tasks must be principled, interpretable, and capable of distinguishing meaningful overlapping network structure from statistical noise at different scales of interest. Here we derive a family of graph mutual information measures that satisfy these criteria and are constructed using only fundamental information theoretic principles. Our measures capture the information shared among networks according to different encodings of their structural information, with our mesoscale mutual information measure allowing for network comparison under any specified network coarse-graining. We test our measures in a range of applications on real and synthetic network data, finding that they effectively highlight intuitive aspects of network similarity across scales in a variety of systems.},

This study systematically benchmarks 12 recent machine learning methods for SL prediction, assessing their performance across diverse data splitting scenarios, negative sample ratios, and negative sampling techniques, on both classification and ranking tasks. We observe that all the methods can perform significantly better by improving data quality, e.g., excluding computationally derived SLs from training and sampling negative labels based on gene expression. Among the methods, SLMGAE performs the best. Furthermore, the methods have limitations in realistic scenarios such as cold-start independent tests and context-specific SLs. These results, together with source code and datasets made freely available, provide guidance for selecting suitable methods and developing more powerful techniques for SL virtual screening.},

In this method, a hyperedge convolution operation is designed to handle the data correlation during representation learning. In this way, traditional hypergraph learning procedure can be conducted using hyperedge convolution operations efficiently. HGNN is able to learn the hidden layer representation considering the high-order data structure, which is a general framework considering the complex data correlations. We have conducted experiments on citation network classification and visual object recognition tasks and compared HGNN with graph convolutional networks and other traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HGNN method outperforms recent state-of-theart methods.

We use the example of transcription to discuss structure–function relationships in condensates. Various types of transcriptional condensates have been reported across the evolutionary spectrum in the cell nucleus as well as in mitochondrial and bacterial nucleoids. In vitro and in vivo observations suggest that transcriptional activity of condensates influences their supramolecular structure, which in turn affects their function. Condensate organization thus becomes driven by differences in miscibility among the DNA and proteins of the transcription machinery and the RNA transcripts they generate. These considerations are in line with the notion that cellular processes shape the structural properties of condensates, leading to a dynamic, mutual interplay between structure and function in the cell.},

However, precise decoding of genomic sequences demands the comprehension of rich contextual information spread over thousands of nucleotides. Presently, only a few architectures exist that can process such extensive inputs, and they require exceptional computational resources. To address this need, we introduce GENA-LM, a suite of transformer-based foundational DNA language models capable of handling input lengths up to 36 thousands base pairs. We offer pre-trained versions of GENA-LM and demonstrate their capacity for fine-tuning to address complex biological questions with modest computational requirements. We also illustrate diverse applications of GENA-LM for various downstream genomic tasks, showcasing its performance in either matching or exceeding that of prior models, whether task-specific or universal.

  abstract = {Biological networks constructed from varied data, including protein-protein interactions, gene expression data, and genetic interactions can be used to map cellular function, but each data type has individual limitations such as bias and incompleteness. Unsupervised network integration promises to address these limitations by combining and automatically weighting input information to obtain a more accurate and comprehensive result. However, existing unsupervised network integration methods fail to adequately scale to the number of nodes and networks present in genome-scale data and do not handle partial network overlap. To address these issues, we developed an unsupervised deep learning-based network integration algorithm that incorporates recent advances in reasoning over unstructured data – namely the graph convolutional network (GCN) – and can effectively learn dependencies between any input network, such as those composed of protein-protein interactions, gene co-expression, or genetic interactions. Our method, BIONIC (Biological Network Integration using Convolutions), learns features which contain substantially more functional information compared to existing approaches, linking genes that share diverse functional relationships, including co-complex and shared bioprocess annotation. BIONIC is scalable in both size and quantity of the input networks, making it feasible to integrate numerous networks on the scale of the human genome.},

Here, we compared the effects of 23 transcription factor (TF) deletions on high-temperature ethanol fermentation and cell survival after heat shock treatment and identified three core TFs, Sin3p, Srb2p and Mig1p, that are involved in regulating the response to long-term thermotolerance. Further analyses of comparative transcriptome profiling of the core TF deletions and transcription regulatory associations revealed a hierarchical transcriptional regulatory network centered on these three~TFs. This global transcriptional regulatory network provided a better understanding of the regulatory mechanism behind long-term thermal stress tolerance as well as potential targets for transcriptome engineering to improve the performance of high-temperature ethanol fermentation by an industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain.},

In turn, Bayesian diffusion models, that map this low-dimensional manifold onto its corresponding high-dimensional space, operate on batches of physics correlated, time sequences of data and capture the statistics of the system dynamics. We demonstrate the capabilities and drawbacks of G-LED in simulations of several benchmark systems, including the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation, two-dimensional high Reynolds number flow over a backward-facing step, and simulations of three-dimensional turbulent channel flow. The results demonstrate that generative learning offers new frontiers for the accurate forecasting of the statistical properties of high-dimensional systems at a reduced computational cost.},

  abstract = {Overfitting and long training time are two fundamental challenges in multilayered neural network learning and deep learning in particular. Dropout and batch normalization are two well-recognized approaches to tackle these challenges. While both approaches share overlapping design principles, numerous research results have shown that they have unique strengths to improve deep learning. Many tools simplify these two approaches as a simple function call, allowing flexible stacking to form deep learning architectures. Although their usage guidelines are available, unfortunately no well-defined set of rules or comprehensive studies to investigate them concerning data input, network configurations, learning efficiency, and accuracy. It is not clear when users should consider using dropout and/or batch normalization, and how they should be combined (or used alternatively) to achieve optimized deep learning outcomes. In this paper we conduct an empirical study to investigate the effect of dropout and batch normalization on training deep learning models. We use multilayered dense neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNN) as the deep learning models, and mix dropout and batch normalization to design different architectures and subsequently observe their performance in terms of training and test CPU time, number of parameters in the model (as a proxy for model size), and classification accuracy. The interplay between network structures, dropout, and batch normalization, allow us to conclude when and how dropout and batch normalization should be considered in deep learning. The empirical study quantified the increase in training time when dropout and batch normalization are used, as well as the increase in prediction time (important for constrained environments, such as smartphones and low-powered IoT devices). It showed that a non-adaptive optimizer (e.g. SGD) can outperform adaptive optimizers, but only at the cost of a significant amount of training times to perform hyperparameter tuning, while an adaptive optimizer (e.g. RMSProp) performs well without much tuning. Finally, it showed that dropout and batch normalization should be used in CNNs only with caution and experimentation (when in doubt and short on time to experiment, use only batch normalization).},

  abstract = {Co-expression of two or more genes at the single-cell level is usually associated with functional co-regulation. While mRNA co-expression—measured as the correlation in mRNA levels—can be influenced by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events, transcriptional regulation is typically considered dominant. We review and connect the literature describing transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of co-expression. To enhance our understanding, we integrate four datasets spanning single-cell gene expression data, single-cell promoter activity data and individual transcript half-lives. Confirming expectations, we find that positive co-expression necessitates promoter coordination and similar mRNA half-lives. Surprisingly, negative co-expression is favored by differences in mRNA half-lives, contrary to initial predictions from stochastic simulations. Notably, this association manifests specifically within clusters of genes. We further observe a striking compensation between promoter coordination and mRNA half-lives, which additional stochastic simulations suggest might give rise to the observed co-expression patterns. These findings raise intriguing questions about the functional advantages conferred by this compensation between distal kinetic steps.},

  abstract = {Deep learning, despite its remarkable achievements, is still a young field. Like the early stages of many scientific disciplines, it is marked by the discovery of new phenomena, ad-hoc design decisions, and the lack of a uniform and compositional mathematical foundation. From the intricacies of the implementation of backpropagation, through a growing zoo of neural network architectures, to the new and poorly understood phenomena such as double descent, scaling laws or in-context learning, there are few unifying principles in deep learning. This thesis develops a novel mathematical foundation for deep learning based on the language of category theory. We develop a new framework that is a) end-to-end, b) unform, and c) not merely descriptive, but prescriptive, meaning it is amenable to direct implementation in programming languages with sufficient features. We also systematise many existing approaches, placing many existing constructions and concepts from the literature under the same umbrella. In Part I we identify and model two main properties of deep learning systems parametricity and bidirectionality by we expand on the previously defined construction of actegories and Para to study the former, and define weighted optics to study the latter. Combining them yields parametric weighted optics, a categorical model of artificial neural networks, and more. Part II justifies the abstractions from Part I, applying them to model backpropagation, architectures, and supervised learning. We provide a lens-theoretic axiomatisation of differentiation, covering not just smooth spaces, but discrete settings of boolean circuits as well. We survey existing, and develop new categorical models of neural network architectures. We formalise the notion of optimisers and lastly, combine all the existing concepts together, providing a uniform and compositional framework for supervised learning.},

These complex, highly detailed models account for the activity of every molecule in a cell and serve as comprehensive knowledgebases for the modeled system. Their scope and utility far surpass those of other systems models. In fact, whole-cell models (WCMs) are an amalgam of several types of “system” models. The models are simulated using a hybrid modeling method where the appropriate mathematical methods for each biological process are used to simulate their behavior. Given the complexity of the models, the process of developing and curating these models is labor-intensive and to date only a handful of these models have been developed. While whole-cell models provide valuable and novel biological insights, and to date have identified some novel biological phenomena, their most important contribution has been to highlight the discrepancy between available data and observations that are used for the parametrization and validation of complex biological models. Another realization has been that current whole-cell modeling simulators are slow and to run models that mimic more complex (e.g., multi-cellular) biosystems, those need to be executed in an accelerated fashion on high-performance computing platforms. In this manuscript, we review the progress of whole-cell modeling to date and discuss some of the ways that they can be improved.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, most methods could be significantly improved, especially in accuracy, scalability, and often lack adequate comparisons to negative controls. There is a lack of consistency in distinguishing assays, in which accuracy is the main goal, from screens, in which scalability is prioritized over accuracy. We dissected and modernized the original definitions of assays and screens based upon recent developments and the conceptual framework of the original definitions. All methods have three components: design/measurement, performance, and interpretation. We propose a model of method development in which reproducible observations become new methods, initially assessed by sensitivity. Further development can proceed along a path to either screens or assays. The screen path focuses on scalability first, but can later prioritize analysis of negatives. Alternatively, the assay path first compares results to negative controls, assessing specificity and accuracy, later adding scalability. Both pathways converge on a high-accuracy and throughput (HAT) assay, like next generation sequencing, which we suggest should be the ultimate goal of all testing methods. Our model will help scientists better select among available methods, as well as improve existing methods, expanding their impact on science.},

Conventional genetic screens exhibit biases, and genes contributing to a phenotype are often missed. We systematically constructed a nearly complete collection of gene-deletion mutants (96\% of annotated open reading frames, or ORFs) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA sequences dubbed ‘molecular bar codes’ uniquely identify each strain, enabling their growth to be analysed in parallel and the fitness contribution of each gene to be quantitatively assessed by hybridization to high-density oligonucleotide arrays. We show that previously known and new genes are necessary for optimal growth under six well-studied conditions: high salt, sorbitol, galactose, pH 8, minimal medium and nystatin treatment. Less than 7\% of genes that exhibit a significant increase in messenger RNA expression are also required for optimal growth in four of the tested conditions. Our results validate the yeast gene-deletion collection as a valuable resource for functional genomics.},

The theory is based on short range activation, long range inhibition, and a distinction between activator and inhibitor concentrations on one hand, and the densities of their sources on the other. While source density is expected to change slowly, e.g. as an effect of cell differentiation, the concentration of activators and inhibitors can change rapidly to establish the primary pattern; this results from auto- and cross catalytic effects on the sources, spreading by diffusion or other mechanisms, and degradation.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the state-of-the-art model for machine learning on graph-structured data. The most popular class of GNNs operate by exchanging information between adjacent nodes, and are known as Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). Given their widespread use, understanding the expressive power of MPNNs is a key question. However, existing results typically consider settings with uninformative node features. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis to determine which function classes of node features can be learned by an MPNN of a given capacity. We do so by measuring the level of pairwise interactions between nodes that MPNNs allow for. This measure provides a novel quantitative characterization of the so-called over-squashing effect, which is observed to occur when a large volume of messages is aggregated into fixed-size vectors. Using our measure, we prove that, to guarantee sufficient communication between pairs of nodes, the capacity of the MPNN must be large enough, depending on properties of the input graph structure, such as commute times. For many relevant scenarios, our analysis results in impossibility statements in practice, showing that over-squashing hinders the expressive power of MPNNs. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive controlled experiments and ablation studies.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have succeeded in various computer science applications, yet deep GNNs underperform their shallow counterparts despite deep learning's success in other domains. Over-smoothing and over-squashing are key challenges when stacking graph convolutional layers, hindering deep representation learning and information propagation from distant nodes. Our work reveals that over-smoothing and over-squashing are intrinsically related to the spectral gap of the graph Laplacian, resulting in an inevitable trade-off between these two issues, as they cannot be alleviated simultaneously. To achieve a suitable compromise, we propose adding and removing edges as a viable approach. We introduce the Stochastic Jost and Liu Curvature Rewiring (SJLR) algorithm, which is computationally efficient and preserves fundamental properties compared to previous curvature-based methods. Unlike existing approaches, SJLR performs edge addition and removal during GNN training while maintaining the graph unchanged during testing. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate SJLR's competitive performance in addressing over-smoothing and over-squashing.},

The availability of an increasing amount of biological data from molecular biological networks promises a deeper understanding but confronts researchers with the problem of combinatorial explosion. The amount of qualitative network data is growing much faster than the amount of quantitative data, such as enzyme kinetics. In many cases it is even impossible to measure quantitative data because of limitations of experimental methods, or for ethical reasons. Thus, a huge amount of qualitative data, such as interaction data, is available, but it was not sufficiently used for modeling purposes, until now. New approaches have been developed, but the complexity of data often limits the application of many of the methods. Biochemical Petri nets make it possible to explore static and dynamic qualitative system properties. One Petri net approach is model validation based on the computation of the system's invariant properties, focusing on t-invariants. T-invariants correspond to subnetworks, which describe the basic system behavior.},

These should offer a comprehensive, structured and interactive overview of a biological mechanism. However, combining single-omic datasets in a meaningful manner has so far proved challenging, and the discovery of new biological information lags behind expectation. One reason is that experiments conducted in different laboratories can typically not to be combined without restriction. Second, the interpretation of multi-omic datasets represents a significant challenge by nature, as the biological datasets are heterogeneous not only for technical, but also for biological, chemical, and physical reasons. Here, multi-layer network theory and methods of artificial intelligence might contribute to solve these problems. For the efficient application of machine learning however, biological datasets need to become more systematic, more precise – and much larger.

Our procedure accurately integrates transcriptomic data with independent single-cell measurements of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation and protein levels. Moreover, we demonstrate how dictionary learning can be combined with sketching techniques to improve computational scalability and harmonize 8.6 million human immune cell profiles from sequencing and mass cytometry experiments.

  abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models are powerful tools for understanding cellular physiology. Flux balance analysis (FBA), in particular, is an optimization-based approach widely employed for predicting metabolic phenotypes. In model microbes such as Escherichia coli, FBA has been successful at predicting essential genes, i.e. those genes that impair survival when deleted. A central assumption in this approach is that both wild type and deletion strains optimize the same fitness objective. Although the optimality assumption may hold for the wild type metabolic network, deletion strains are not subject to the same evolutionary pressures and knock-out mutants may steer their metabolism to meet other objectives for survival. Here, we present FlowGAT, a hybrid FBA-machine learning strategy for predicting essentiality directly from wild type metabolic phenotypes. The approach is based on graph-structured representation of metabolic fluxes predicted by FBA, where nodes correspond to enzymatic reactions and edges quantify the propagation of metabolite mass flow between a reaction and its neighbours. We integrate this information into a graph neural network that can be trained on knock-out fitness assay data. Comparisons across different model architectures reveal that FlowGAT predictions for E. coli are close to those of FBA for several growth conditions. This suggests that essentiality of enzymatic genes can be predicted by exploiting the inherent network structure of metabolism. Our approach demonstrates the benefits of combining the mechanistic insights afforded by genome-scale models with the ability of deep learning to infer patterns from complex datasets.},

A general and efficient algorithm for fitting a generalized additive model consists of a hierarchy of three modules: scatterplot smoothers, backfitting algorithm, and local-scoring algorithm. These three steps are a rather natural and intuitive generalization of the usual linear model algorithms, and that is how they were originally conceived. The algorithm for fitting a gam is exactly analogous to the algorithm for glms. The chapter presents the S functions for fitting and understanding generalized additive models. In some cases, especially for generalized linear or additive models, adding residuals to a plot is unhelpful because they can distort the scale dramatically. Any interesting features in the functions get lost because of a few large residuals, even though they may carry a very small weight.},

Extending graph pre-trained models to web-scale graphs with billions of nodes in industrial scenarios, while avoiding negative transfer across graphs or tasks, remains a challenge. We aim to develop a general graph pre-trained model with inductive ability that can make predictions for unseen new nodes and even new graphs. In this work, we introduce a scalable transformer-based graph pre-training framework called PGT (Pre-trained Graph Transformer). Specifically, we design a flexible and scalable graph transformer as the backbone network. Meanwhile, based on the masked autoencoder architecture, we design two pre-training tasks: one for reconstructing node features and the other one for reconstructing local structures. Unlike the original autoencoder architecture where the pre-trained decoder is discarded, we propose a novel strategy that utilizes the decoder for feature augmentation. We have deployed our framework on Tencent's online game data. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our framework can perform pre-training on real-world web-scale graphs with over 540 million nodes and 12 billion edges and generalizes effectively to unseen new graphs with different downstream tasks. We further conduct experiments on the publicly available ogbn-papers100M dataset, which consists of 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on both industrial datasets and public datasets, while also enjoying scalability and efficiency.},

Such documents are extremely important in numerous domains, including science, law or medicine. However, most existing solutions are inefficient and fail to make use of the structure inherent to documents. HDT exploits document structure by introducing auxiliary anchor tokens and redesigning the attention mechanism into a sparse multi-level hierarchy. This approach facilitates information exchange between tokens at different levels while maintaining sparsity, thereby enhancing computational and memory efficiency while exploiting the document structure as an inductive bias. We address the technical challenge of implementing HDT's sample-dependent hierarchical attention pattern by developing a novel sparse attention kernel that considers the hierarchical structure of documents. As demonstrated by our experiments, utilizing structural information present in documents leads to faster convergence, higher sample efficiency and better performance on downstream tasks.},

Our aim was to introduce tools to quantify population heterogeneity in bioprocesses using a combination of reporter strains, flow cytometry, and easily comprehensible parameters. We calculated mean, mode, peak width, and coefficient of variance to describe distribution characteristics and temporal shifts in fluorescence intensity. The skewness and the slope of cumulative distribution function plots illustrated differences in distribution shape. These parameters are person-independent and precise.

Cell robustness, measured as membrane integrity after exposure to freeze-thaw treatment, of fast-growing cells was strongly affected in subpopulations of low membrane robustness. Glucose pulses protected subpopulations of fast-growing but not slower-growing yeast cells against membrane damage.

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing measures gene expression at an unprecedented resolution and scale and allows the analysis of cellular phenotypes which was not possible before. In this context, graphs occur as a natural representation of the system —both as gene-centric and cell-centric. However, many advances in machine learning on graphs are not yet harnessed in models on single-cell data. Taking the inference of cell types or gene interactions as examples, graph representation learning has a wide applicability to both cell and gene graphs. Recent advances in spatial molecular profiling additionally put graph learning in the focus of attention because of the innate resemblance of spatial information to spatial graphs. We argue that graph embedding techniques have great potential for various applications across single-cell biology. Here, we discuss how graph representation learning maps to current models and concepts used in single-cell biology and formalise overlaps to developments in graph-based deep learning.},

Recent work introduced novel applications of graph neural networks for solving quadratic-cost combinatorial optimization problems. However, effective utilization of models such as graph neural networks to address general problems with higher-order constraints is an unresolved challenge. This paper presents a framework, HypOp, that advances the state of the art for solving combinatorial optimization problems in several aspects: (1) it generalizes the prior results to higher-order constrained problems with arbitrary cost functions by leveraging hypergraph neural networks; (2) it enables scalability to larger problems by introducing a new distributed and parallel training architecture; (3) it demonstrates generalizability across different problem formulations by transferring knowledge within the same hypergraph; (4) it substantially boosts the solution accuracy compared with the prior art by suggesting a fine-tuning step using simulated annealing; and (5) it shows remarkable progress on numerous benchmark examples, including hypergraph MaxCut, satisfiability and resource allocation problems, with notable run-time improvements using a combination of fine-tuning and distributed training techniques. We showcase the application of HypOp in scientific discovery by solving a hypergraph MaxCut problem on a National Drug Code drug-substance hypergraph. Through extensive experimentation on various optimization problems, HypOp demonstrates superiority over existing unsupervised-learning-based solvers and generic optimization methods.},

  abstract = {A graph is a suitable data structure to represent the structural information of text. Recently, multi-hop question answering (MHQA) tasks, which require inter-paragraph/sentence linkages, have come to exploit such properties of a graph. Previous approaches to MHQA relied on leveraging the graph information along with the pre-trained language model (PLM) encoders. However, this trend exhibits the following drawbacks: (i) sample inefficiency while training in a low-resource setting; (ii) lack of reusability due to changes in the model structure or input. Our work proposes the Graph-Induced Transformer (GIT) that applies graph-derived attention patterns directly into a PLM, without the need to employ external graph modules. GIT can leverage the useful inductive bias of graphs while retaining the unperturbed Transformer structure and parameters. Our experiments on HotpotQA successfully demonstrate both the sample efficient characteristic of GIT and its capacity to replace the graph modules while preserving model performance.},

  abstract = {Hypergraph, an expressive structure with flexibility to model the higher-order correlations among entities, has recently attracted increasing attention from various research domains. Despite the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for graph representation learning, how to adapt the powerful GNN-variants directly into hypergraphs remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose UniGNN, a unified framework for interpreting the message passing process in graph and hypergraph neural networks, which can generalize general GNN models into hypergraphs. In this framework, meticulously-designed architectures aiming to deepen GNNs can also be incorporated into hypergraphs with the least effort. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of UniGNN on multiple real-world datasets, which outperform the state-of-the-art approaches with a large margin. Especially for the DBLP dataset, we increase the accuracy from 77.4\textbackslash\% to 88.8\textbackslash\% in the semi-supervised hypernode classification task. We further prove that the proposed message-passing based UniGNN models are at most as powerful as the 1-dimensional Generalized Weisfeiler-Leman (1-GWL) algorithm in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic hypergraphs.

Here, we study plasmid retention dynamics within a population of plasmid-complemented ura3∆0 yeast cells, and show that the exchange of complementary metabolites between plasmid-carrying prototrophs and plasmid-free auxotrophs allows the latter to survive and proliferate in selective environments. This process also affects plasmid copy number in plasmid-carrying prototrophs, further promoting cellular functional heterogeneity. Finally, we show that targeted genetic engineering can be used to suppress cross-feeding and reduce the frequency of plasmid-free auxotrophs, or to exploit it for intentional population diversification and division of labour in co-culture systems.},

A multitude of studies in the last two decades have aimed to map and characterize transcriptional networks in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We review the methodologies and accomplishments of these studies, as well as challenges we now face. For most yeast TFs, data have been collected on their sequence preferences, in vivo promoter occupancy, and gene expression profiles in deletion mutants. These systematic studies have led to the identification of new regulators of numerous cellular functions and shed light on the overall organization of yeast gene regulation. However, many yeast TFs appear to be inactive under standard laboratory growth conditions, and many of the available data were collected using techniques that have since been improved. Perhaps as a consequence, comprehensive and accurate mapping among TF sequence preferences, promoter binding, and gene expression remains an open challenge. We propose that the time is ripe for renewed systematic efforts toward a complete mapping of yeast transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Grokking, or delayed generalization, is a phenomenon where generalization in a deep neural network (DNN) occurs long after achieving near zero training error. Previous studies have reported the occurrence of grokking in specific controlled settings, such as DNNs initialized with large-norm parameters or transformers trained on algorithmic datasets. We demonstrate that grokking is actually much more widespread and materializes in a wide range of practical settings, such as training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) on CIFAR10 or a Resnet on Imagenette. We introduce the new concept of delayed robustness, whereby a DNN groks adversarial examples and becomes robust, long after interpolation and/or generalization. We develop an analytical explanation for the emergence of both delayed generalization and delayed robustness based on the local complexity of a DNN's input-output mapping. Our local complexity measures the density of so-called linear regions (aka, spline partition regions) that tile the DNN input space and serves as a utile progress measure for training. We provide the first evidence that, for classification problems, the linear regions undergo a phase transition during training whereafter they migrate away from the training samples (making the DNN mapping smoother there) and towards the decision boundary (making the DNN mapping less smooth there). Grokking occurs post phase transition as a robust partition of the input space thanks to the linearization of the DNN mapping around the training points. Website: https://bit.ly/grok-adversarial},

  abstract = {Many applications of machine learning require a model to make accurate predictions on test examples that are distributionally different from training ones, while task-specific labels are scarce during training. An effective approach to this challenge is to pre-train a model on related tasks where data is abundant, and then fine-tune it on a downstream task of interest. While pre-training has been effective in many language and vision domains, it remains an open question how to effectively use pre-training on graph datasets. In this paper, we develop a new strategy and self-supervised methods for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The key to the success of our strategy is to pre-train an expressive GNN at the level of individual nodes as well as entire graphs so that the GNN can learn useful local and global representations simultaneously. We systematically study pre-training on multiple graph classification datasets. We find that naïve strategies, which pre-train GNNs at the level of either entire graphs or individual nodes, give limited improvement and can even lead to negative transfer on many downstream tasks. In contrast, our strategy avoids negative transfer and improves generalization significantly across downstream tasks, leading up to 9.4\% absolute improvements in ROC-AUC over non-pre-trained models and achieving state-of-the-art performance for molecular property prediction and protein function prediction.},

  abstract = {Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) play a key role in diverse biological processes but only a small subset of the interactions has been experimentally identified. Additionally, high-throughput experimental techniques that detect PPIs are known to suffer various limitations, such as exaggerated false positives and negatives rates. The semantic similarity derived from the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation is regarded as one of the most powerful indicators for protein interactions. However, while computational approaches for prediction of PPIs have gained popularity in recent years, most methods fail to capture the specificity of GO terms.We propose TransformerGO, a model that is capable of capturing the semantic similarity between GO sets dynamically using an attention mechanism. We generate dense graph embeddings for GO terms using an algorithmic framework for learning continuous representations of nodes in networks called node2vec. TransformerGO learns deep semantic relations between annotated terms and can distinguish between negative and positive interactions with high accuracy. TransformerGO outperforms classic semantic similarity measures on gold standard PPI datasets and state-of-the-art machine-learning-based approaches on large datasets from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens. We show how the neural attention mechanism embedded in the transformer architecture detects relevant functional terms when predicting interactions.https://github.com/Ieremie/TransformerGO.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Effective treatments for COVID-19 are urgently needed. However, discovering single-agent therapies with activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been challenging. Combination therapies play an important role in antiviral therapies, due to their improved efficacy and reduced toxicity. Recent approaches have applied deep learning to identify synergistic drug combinations for diseases with vast preexisting datasets, but these are not applicable to new diseases with limited combination data, such as COVID-19. Given that drug synergy often occurs through inhibition of discrete biological targets, here we propose a neural network architecture that jointly learns drug−target interaction and drug−drug synergy. The model consists of two parts: a drug−target interaction module and a target−disease association module. This design enables the model to utilize drug−target interaction data and single-agent antiviral activity data, in addition to available drug−drug combination datasets, which may be small in nature. By incorporating additional biological information, our model performs significantly better in synergy prediction accuracy than previous methods with limited drug combination training data. We empirically validated our model predictions and discovered two drug combinations, remdesivir and reserpine as well as remdesivir and IQ-1S, which display strong antiviral SARS-CoV-2 synergy in vitro. Our approach, which was applied here to address the urgent threat of COVID-19, can be readily extended to other diseases for which a dearth of chemical−chemical combination data exists.},

  abstract = {The success of deep learning notoriously requires larger amounts of costly annotated data. This has led to the development of self-supervised learning (SSL) that aims to alleviate this limitation by creating domain specific pretext tasks on unlabeled data. Simultaneously, there are increasing interests in generalizing deep learning to the graph domain in the form of graph neural networks (GNNs). GNNs can naturally utilize unlabeled nodes through the simple neighborhood aggregation that is unable to thoroughly make use of unlabeled nodes. Thus, we seek to harness SSL for GNNs to fully exploit the unlabeled data. Different from data instances in the image and text domains, nodes in graphs present unique structure information and they are inherently linked indicating not independent and identically distributed (or i.i.d.). Such complexity is a double-edged sword for SSL on graphs. On the one hand, it determines that it is challenging to adopt solutions from the image and text domains to graphs and dedicated efforts are desired. On the other hand, it provides rich information that enables us to build SSL from a variety of perspectives. Thus, in this paper, we first deepen our understandings on when, why, and which strategies of SSL work with GNNs by empirically studying numerous basic SSL pretext tasks on graphs. Inspired by deep insights from the empirical studies, we propose a new direction SelfTask to build advanced pretext tasks that are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various real-world datasets.

By combining droplet microfluidic screening with large-scale CRISPR libraries that perturb the expression of the majority of coding and non-coding genes in               S. cerevisiae               , we identified 345 genes for which an increase or decrease in gene expression resulted in increased secretion of α-amylase. Our results show that modulating the expression of genes involved in the trafficking of vesicles, endosome to Golgi transport, the phagophore assembly site, the cell cycle and energy supply improve α-amylase secretion. Besides protein-coding genes, we also find multiple long non-coding RNAs enriched in the vicinity of genes associated with endosomal, Golgi and vacuolar processes. We validated our results by overexpressing or deleting selected genes, which resulted in significant improvements in α-amylase secretion. The advantages, in terms of precision and speed, inherent to CRISPR based perturbations, enables iterative testing of new strains for increased protein secretion.},

  abstract = {Graph representation learning aims to effectively encode high-dimensional sparse graph-structured data into low-dimensional dense vectors, which is a fundamental task that has been widely studied in a range of fields, including machine learning and data mining. Classic graph embedding methods follow the basic idea that the embedding vectors of interconnected nodes in the graph can still maintain a relatively close distance, thereby preserving the structural information between the nodes in the graph. However, this is sub-optimal due to: (i) traditional methods have limited model capacity which limits the learning performance; (ii) existing techniques typically rely on unsupervised learning strategies and fail to couple with the latest learning paradigms; (iii) representation learning and downstream tasks are dependent on each other which should be jointly enhanced. With the remarkable success of deep learning, deep graph representation learning has shown great potential and advantages over shallow (traditional) methods, there exist a large number of deep graph representation learning techniques have been proposed in the past decade, especially graph neural networks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive survey on current deep graph representation learning algorithms by proposing a new taxonomy of existing state-of-the-art literature. Specifically, we systematically summarize the essential components of graph representation learning and categorize existing approaches by the ways of graph neural network architectures and the most recent advanced learning paradigms. Moreover, this survey also provides the practical and promising applications of deep graph representation learning. Last but not least, we state new perspectives and suggest challenging directions which deserve further investigations in the future.},

Key to this development is the establishment of proper benchmarks and systematic evaluation approaches. The benchmarks that have been proposed so far have focused on tasks that depend on short-range sequence contexts, while the evaluation of models for long-range tasks that are integral to genomics, such as gene expression and genetic variant prediction, is lacking. In this work, we propose a benchmark that fills this need and introduce the genomics long-range benchmark -- an evaluation tool that is designed to encompass tasks requiring long-range sequence dependencies, an aspect which we deem crucial to genomic applications of DNA language models. In addition to clearly defining and organizing relevant tasks into a cohesive benchmark, we provide preliminary results of several prominent and recent DNA LMs evaluated on the proposed benchmark. Finally, we probe the tasks in our benchmarks by exploring the effect of context length extension methods for one of the evaluated DNA LMs, the Nucleotide Transformer. By proposing this benchmark we hope to stimulate the ongoing development of DNA LMs and provide a fruitful testing ground for future developments that aim to capture long-range sequence modeling in genomics.},

To this end, new algorithms are needed that can leverage conservation to capture regulatory elements while accounting for their evolution. Here we introduce species-aware DNA language models (LMs), which we trained on more than 800 species spanning over 500 million years of evolution. Investigating their ability to predict masked nucleotides from context, we show that DNA LMs distinguish transcription factor and RNA-binding protein motifs from background non-coding sequence. Owing to their flexibility, DNA LMs capture conserved regulatory elements over much further evolutionary distances than sequence alignment would allow. Remarkably, DNA LMs reconstruct motif instances bound in vivo better than unbound ones and account for the evolution of motif sequences and their positional constraints, showing that these models capture functional high-order sequence and evolutionary context. We further show that species-aware training yields improved sequence representations for endogenous and MPRA-based gene expression prediction, as well as motif discovery. Collectively, these results demonstrate that species-aware DNA language models are a powerful, flexible, and scalable tool to integrate information from large compendia of highly diverged genomes.},

We identified a pronounced randomness in feature selection in DNNs due to its stochastic nature, which may hinder interpretability and give rise to misleading results. We propose an interpretable neural network model, stabilized using ensembling, with controlled variable selection for genetic studies. The merit of the proposed method includes: flexible modelling of the nonlinear effect of genetic variants to improve statistical power; multiple knockoffs in the input layer to rigorously control the false discovery rate; hierarchical layers to substantially reduce the number of weight parameters and activations, and improve computational efficiency; and stabilized feature selection to reduce the randomness in identified signals. We evaluate the proposed method in extensive simulation studies and apply it to the analysis of Alzheimer’s disease genetics. We show that the proposed method, when compared with conventional linear and nonlinear methods, can lead to substantially more discoveries.},

  abstract = {Despite ever-increasing accumulation of genomic data, the fundamental question of how individual genes are switched on during development, lineage-specification and differentiation is not fully answered. It is widely accepted that this involves the interaction between at least three fundamental regulatory elements: enhancers, promoters and insulators. Enhancers contain transcription factor binding sites which are bound by transcription factors (TFs) and co-factors expressed during cell fate decisions and maintain imposed patterns of activation, at least in part, via their epigenetic modification. This information is transferred from enhancers to their cognate promoters often by coming into close physical proximity to form a ‘transcriptional hub’ containing a high concentration of TFs and co-factors. The mechanisms underlying these stages of transcriptional activation are not fully explained. This review focuses on how enhancers and promoters are activated during differentiation and how multiple enhancers work together to regulate gene expression. We illustrate the currently understood principles of how mammalian enhancers work and how they may be perturbed in enhanceropathies using expression of the α-globin gene cluster during erythropoiesis, as a model.},

New features are discussed, as well as developments in the community of contributors. New features include a zoomable pathway viewer, support for pathway ontology annotations, the ability to mark pathways as private for a limited time and the availability of stable hyperlinks to pathways and the elements therein. WikiPathways content is freely available in a variety of formats such as the BioPAX standard, and the content is increasingly adopted by external databases and tools, including Wikipedia. A recent development is the use of WikiPathways as a staging ground for centrally curated databases such as Reactome. WikiPathways is seeing steady growth in the number of users, page views and edits for each pathway. To assess whether the community curation experiment can be considered successful, here we analyze the relation between use and contribution, which gives results in line with other wiki projects. The novel use of pathway pages as supplementary material to publications, as well as the addition of tailored content for research domains, is expected to stimulate growth further.},

Results In this review we have identified and summarized the existing methods for infering causality in large-scale causal molecular networks, and discussed important factors that will need to be considered in future research in this area. Conclusion Existing methods to infering causal molecular networks have their own strengths and limitations so there is no one best approach, and it is instead down to the discretion of the researcher. This review also to discusses some of the current limitations to biological interpretation of these networks, and important factors to consider for future studies on molecular networks.},

We therefore monitored mRNA expression genome-wide, for individual deletions of one-quarter of yeast genes, focusing on (putative) regulators. The resulting genetic perturbation signatures reflect many different properties. These include the architecture of protein complexes and pathways, identification of expression changes compatible with viability, and the varying responsiveness to genetic perturbation. The data are assembled into a genetic perturbation network that shows different connectivities for different classes of regulators. Four feed-forward loop (FFL) types are overrepresented, including incoherent type 2 FFLs that likely represent feedback. Systematic transcription factor classification shows a surprisingly high abundance of gene-specific repressors, suggesting that yeast chromatin is not as generally restrictive to transcription as is often assumed. The data set is useful for studying individual genes and for discovering properties of an entire regulatory system.},

Thus, the observable macroscopic ‘average’ cannot outright be used as representative of the ‘average cell’. Rather, it is the resulting emerging behaviour of the actions and interactions of many different cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) enables the comparison of the transcriptomes of individual cells. This provides high-resolution maps of the dynamic cellular programmes allowing us to answer fundamental biological questions on their function and evolution. It also allows to address medical questions such as the role of rare cell populations contributing to disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Furthermore, it provides an understanding of context-specific dependencies, namely the behaviour and function that a cell has in a specific context, which can be crucial to understand some complex diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Here, we provide an overview of scRNA-Seq, including a comparative review of emerging technologies and computational pipelines. We discuss the current and emerging applications and focus on tumour heterogeneity a clear example of how scRNA-Seq can provide new understanding of a complex disease. Additionally, we review the limitations and highlight the need of powerful computational pipelines and reproducible protocols for the broader acceptance of this technique in basic and clinical research.},

Complexes can form from stochastic post-translational interactions of fully formed proteins, but recent attention has shifted to co-translational interactions in which the most common mechanism involves binding of a mature constituent to an incomplete polypeptide emerging from a translating ribosome. Studies in yeast have revealed co-translational interactions during formation of multiple major complexes, and together with recent mammalian cell studies, suggest widespread utilization of the mechanism. These translation-dependent interactions can involve a single or multiple mRNA templates, can be uni- or bi-directional, and can use multi-protein sub-complexes as a binding component. Here, we discuss benefits of co-translational complex assembly including accuracy and efficiency, overcoming hidden interfaces, localized and hierarchical assembly, and reduction of orphan protein degradation, toxicity, and dominant-negative pathogenesis, all serving to improve cell fitness.},

The scBERT method, inspired by the success of BERT (‘bidirectional encoder representations from transformers’) in natural language processing, was recently introduced by Yang et al. as a data-driven tool to annotate cell types in single-cell genomics data. Analogous to contextual embedding in BERT, scBERT leverages pretraining and self-attention mechanisms to learn the ‘transcriptional grammar’ of cells. Here we investigate the reusability beyond the original datasets, assessing the generalizability of natural language techniques in single-cell genomics. The degree of imbalance in the cell-type distribution substantially influences the performance of scBERT. Anticipating an increased utilization of transformers, we highlight the necessity to consider data distribution carefully and introduce a subsampling technique to mitigate the influence of an imbalanced distribution. Our analysis serves as a stepping stone towards understanding and optimizing the use of transformers in single-cell genomics.},

Parameterization is carried out using a genetic algorithm by simultaneously imposing all available fluxomic data (about 30 measured fluxes per mutant). The Pearson correlation coefficient between experimental data and predicted product yields for 320 engineered strains spanning 24 product metabolites is 0.84. This is substantially higher than that using flux balance analysis, minimization of metabolic adjustment or maximization of product yield exhibiting systematic errors with correlation coefficients of, respectively, 0.18, 0.37 and 0.47 (k-ecoli457 is available for download at http://www.maranasgroup.com).},

Moreover, it is unknown how existing motor memories are maintained as new motor skills are continuously acquired. Here we tracked neural representation of learned actions throughout a significant portion of the lifespan of a mouse and show that learned actions are stably retained in combination with context, which protects existing memories from erasure during new motor learning. We established a continual learning paradigm in which mice learned to perform directional licking in different task contexts while we tracked motor cortex activity for up to six months using two-photon imaging. Within the same task context, activity driving directional licking was stable over time with little representational drift. When learning new task contexts, new preparatory activity emerged to drive the same licking actions. Learning created parallel new motor memories instead of modifying existing representations. Re-learning to make the same actions in the previous task context re-activated the previous preparatory activity, even months later. Continual learning of new task contexts kept creating new preparatory activity patterns. Context-specific memories, as we observed in the motor system, may provide a solution for stable memory storage throughout continual learning.},

The high abundance of publicly available data that has been generated through diverse ‘omics’ approaches has led to the use of yeast for many systems biology studies, including large-scale gene network modeling to better understand the molecular basis of the cellular phenotype. We have previously developed a genome-scale gene network for yeast, YeastNet v2, which has been used for various genetics and systems biology studies. Here, we present an updated version, YeastNet v3 (available at http://www.inetbio.org/yeastnet/), that significantly improves the prediction of gene–phenotype associations. The extended genome in YeastNet v3 covers up to 5818 genes (∼99\% of the coding genome) wired by 362 512 functional links. YeastNet v3 provides a new web interface to run the tools for network-guided hypothesis generations. YeastNet v3 also provides edge information for all data-specific networks (∼2 million functional links) as well as the integrated networks. Therefore, users can construct alternative versions of the integrated network by applying their own data integration algorithm to the same data-specific links.},

It can also be difficult to keep pace with rapidly expanding biological knowledge, which often results in daily changes to any of the over 47,000 gene ontologies that describe biological knowledge. GOATOOLS, a Python-based library, makes it more efficient to stay current with the latest ontologies and annotations, perform gene ontology enrichment analyses to determine over- and under-represented terms, and organize results for greater clarity and easier interpretation using a novel GOATOOLS GO grouping method. We performed functional analyses on both stochastic simulation data and real data from a published RNA-seq study to compare the enrichment results from GOATOOLS to two other popular tools: DAVID and GOstats.

  abstract = {We introduce a new information-geometric structure associated with the dynamics on discrete objects such as graphs and hypergraphs. The presented setup consists of two dually flat structures built on the vertex and edge spaces, respectively. The former is the conventional duality between density and potential, e.g., the probability density and its logarithmic form induced by a convex thermodynamic function. The latter is the duality between flux and force induced by a convex and symmetric dissipation function, which drives the dynamics of the density. These two are connected topologically by the homological algebraic relation induced by the underlying discrete objects. The generalized gradient flow in this doubly dual flat structure is an extension of the gradient flows on Riemannian manifolds, which include Markov jump processes and nonlinear chemical reaction dynamics as well as the natural gradient. The information-geometric projections on this doubly dual flat structure lead to information-geometric extensions of the Helmholtz–Hodge decomposition and the Otto structure in \$\$L\textasciicircum\{2\}\$\$-Wasserstein geometry. The structure can be extended to non-gradient nonequilibrium flows, from which we also obtain the induced dually flat structure on cycle spaces. This abstract but general framework can broaden the applicability of information geometry to various problems of linear and nonlinear dynamics.},

  abstract = {Hypergraphs can naturally model group-wise relations (e.g., a group of users who co-purchase an item) as hyperedges. Hyperedge prediction is to predict future or unobserved hyperedges, which is a fundamental task in many real-world applications (e.g., group recommendation). Despite the recent breakthrough of hyperedge prediction methods, the following challenges have been rarely studied: (C1) How to aggregate the nodes in each hyperedge candidate for accurate hyperedge prediction? and (C2) How to mitigate the inherent data sparsity problem in hyperedge prediction? To tackle both challenges together, in this paper, we propose a novel hyperedge prediction framework (CASH) that employs (1) context-aware node aggregation to precisely capture complex relations among nodes in each hyperedge for (C1) and (2) self-supervised contrastive learning in the context of hyperedge prediction to enhance hypergraph representations for (C2). Furthermore, as for (C2), we propose a hyperedge-aware augmentation method to fully exploit the latent semantics behind the original hypergraph and consider both node-level and group-level contrasts (i.e., dual contrasts) for better node and hyperedge representations. Extensive experiments on six real-world hypergraphs reveal that CASH consistently outperforms all competing methods in terms of the accuracy in hyperedge prediction and each of the proposed strategies is effective in improving the model accuracy of CASH. For the detailed information of CASH, we provide the code and datasets at: https://github.com/yy-ko/cash.},

An ongoing challenge is to determine the proteins orchestrating DDR and their organization into complexes, including constitutive interactions and those responding to genomic insult. Here, we use multi-conditional network analysis to systematically map DDR assemblies at multiple scales. Affinity purifications of 21 DDR proteins, with/without genotoxin exposure, are combined with multi-omics data to reveal a hierarchical organization of 605 proteins into 109 assemblies. The map captures canonical repair mechanisms and proposes new DDR-associated proteins extending to stress, transport, and chromatin functions. We find that protein assemblies closely align with genetic dependencies in processing specific genotoxins and that proteins in multiple assemblies typically act in multiple genotoxin responses. Followup by DDR functional readouts newly implicates 12 assembly members in double-strand-break repair. The DNA damage response assemblies map is available for interactive visualization and query (ccmi.org/ ddram/).},

As experimental kcat estimates are unavailable for the vast majority of enzymatic reactions, the development of accurate computational prediction methods is highly desirable. However, existing machine learning models are limited to a single, well-studied organism, or they provide inaccurate predictions except for enzymes that are highly similar to proteins in the training set. Here, we present TurNuP, a general and organism-independent model that successfully predicts turnover numbers for natural reactions of wild-type enzymes. We constructed model inputs by representing complete chemical reactions through differential reaction fingerprints and by representing enzymes through a modified and re-trained Transformer Network model for protein sequences. TurNuP outperforms previous models and generalizes well even to enzymes that are not similar to proteins in the training set. Parameterizing metabolic models with TurNuP-predicted kcat values leads to improved proteome allocation predictions. To provide a powerful and convenient tool for the study of molecular biochemistry and physiology, we implemented a TurNuP web server.},

  abstract = {Graph representations are often used to model structured data at an individual or population level and have numerous applications in pattern recognition problems. In the field of neuroscience, where such representations are commonly used to model structural or functional connectivity between a set of brain regions, graphs have proven to be of great importance. This is mainly due to the capability of revealing patterns related to brain development and disease, which were previously unknown. Evaluating similarity between these brain connectivity networks in a manner that accounts for the graph structure and is tailored for a particular application is, however, non-trivial. Most existing methods fail to accommodate the graph structure, discarding information that could be beneficial for further classification or regression analyses based on these similarities. We propose to learn a graph similarity metric using a siamese graph convolutional neural network (s-GCN) in a supervised setting. The proposed framework takes into consideration the graph structure for the evaluation of similarity between a pair of graphs, by employing spectral graph convolutions that allow the generalisation of traditional convolutions to irregular graphs and operates in the graph spectral domain. We apply the proposed model on two datasets: the challenging ABIDE database, which comprises functional MRI data of 403 patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 468 healthy controls aggregated from multiple acquisition sites, and a set of 2500 subjects from UK Biobank. We demonstrate the performance of the method for the tasks of classification between matching and non-matching graphs, as well as individual subject classification and manifold learning, showing that it leads to significantly improved results compared to traditional methods.},

Most duplicated genes are eliminated, and factors that influence the retention of persisting duplicates remain poorly understood.

Mapping of digenic interactions for a deletion mutant of each paralog, and of trigenic interactions for the double mutant, provides insight into their roles and a quantitative measure of their functional redundancy. Trigenic interaction analysis distinguishes two classes of paralogs: a more functionally divergent subset and another that retained more functional overlap.

  abstract = {Trigenic interactions in yeast link bioprocesses                            To dissect the genotype-phenotype landscape of a cell, it is necessary to understand interactions between genes. Building on the digenic protein-protein interaction network, Kuzmin               et al.               created a trigenic landscape of yeast by using a synthetic genetic array (see the Perspective by Walhout). Triple-mutant analyses indicated that the majority of genes with trigenic associations functioned within the same biological processes. These converged on networks identified in the digenic interaction landscape. Although the overall effects were weaker for trigenic than for digenic interactions, trigenic interactions were more likely to bridge biological processes in the cell.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaao1729               ; see also p.               269                        ,              Trigenic interactions in yeast link bioprocesses are explored.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Genetic interactions occur when mutations in different genes combine to result in a phenotype that is different from expectation based on those of the individual mutations. Negative genetic interactions occur when a combination of mutations leads to a fitness defect that is more exacerbated than expected. For example, synthetic lethality occurs when two mutations, neither of which is lethal on its own, generate an inviable double mutant. Alternatively, positive genetic interactions occur when genetic perturbations combine to generate a double mutant with a greater fitness than expected. Global digenic interaction studies have been useful for understanding the functional wiring diagram of the cell and may also provide insight into the genotype-to-phenotype relationship, which is important for tracking the missing heritability of human health and disease. Here we describe a network of higher-order trigenic interactions and explore its implications.                                         RATIONALE               Variation in phenotypic outcomes in different individuals is caused by genetic determinants that act as modifiers. Modifier loci are prevalent in human populations, but knowledge regarding how variants interact to modulate phenotype in different individuals is lacking. Similarly, in yeast, traits including conditional essentiality—in which certain genes are essential in one genetic background but nonessential in another—often result from an interplay of multiple modifier loci. Because complex modifiers may underlie the genetic basis of physiological states found in natural populations, it is critical to understand the landscape of higher-order genetic interactions.                                         RESULTS               To survey trigenic interactions, we designed query strains that sampled key features of the global digenic interaction network: (i) digenic interaction strength, (ii) average number of digenic interactions, and (iii) digenic interaction profile similarity. In total, we tested \textasciitilde 400,000 double and \textasciitilde 200,000 triple mutants for fitness defects and identified \textasciitilde 9500 digenic and \textasciitilde 3200 trigenic negative interactions. Although trigenic interactions tend to be weaker than digenic interactions, they were both enriched for functional relationships. About one-third of trigenic interactions identified “novel” connections that were not observed in our digenic control network, whereas the remaining approximately two-thirds of trigenic interactions “modified” a digenic interaction, suggesting that the global digenic interaction network is important for understanding the trigenic interaction network. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic interactions also bridged distant bioprocesses. We estimate that the global trigenic interaction network is \textasciitilde 100 times as large as the global digenic network, highlighting the potential for complex genetic interactions to affect the biology of inheritance.                                         CONCLUSION               The extensive network of trigenic interactions and their ability to generate functionally diverse phenotypes suggest that higher-order genetic interactions may play a key role in the genotype-to-phenotype relationship, genome size, and speciation.                                                   Systematic analysis of trigenic interactions.                                        We surveyed                                          for trigenic interactions and found that they are \textasciitilde 100 times as prevalent as digenic interactions, often modify a digenic interaction, and connect functionally related genes as well as genes in more diverse bioprocesses (multicolored nodes). PPI, protein-protein interaction.                                                                                            ,              To systematically explore complex genetic interactions, we constructed \textasciitilde 200,000 yeast triple mutants and scored negative trigenic interactions. We selected double-mutant query genes across a broad spectrum of biological processes, spanning a range of quantitative features of the global digenic interaction network and tested for a genetic interaction with a third mutation. Trigenic interactions often occurred among functionally related genes, and essential genes were hubs on the trigenic network. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic interactions tended to link genes in distant bioprocesses and displayed a weaker magnitude than digenic interactions. We estimate that the global trigenic interaction network is \textasciitilde 100 times as large as the global digenic network, highlighting the potential for complex genetic interactions to affect the biology of inheritance, including the genotype-to-phenotype relationship.},

  abstract = {Systematic complex genetic interaction studies have provided insight into high-order functional redundancies and genetic network wiring of the cell. Here, we describe a method for screening and quantifying trigenic interactions from ordered arrays of yeast strains grown on agar plates as individual colonies. The protocol instructs users on the trigenic synthetic genetic array analysis technique, τ-SGA, for high-throughput screens. The steps describe construction of the double-mutant query strains and the corresponding single-mutant control query strains, which are screened in parallel in two replicates. The screening experimental set-up consists of sequential replica-pinning steps that enable automated mating, meiotic recombination and successive haploid selection steps for the generation of triple mutants, which are scored for colony size as a proxy for fitness, which enables the calculation of trigenic interactions. The procedure described here was used to conduct 422 trigenic interaction screens, which generated \textasciitilde 460,000 yeast triple mutants for trigenic interaction analysis. Users should be familiar with robotic equipment required for high-throughput genetic interaction screens and be proficient at the command line to execute the scoring pipeline. Large-scale screen computational analysis is achieved by using MATLAB pipelines that score raw colony size data to produce τ-SGA interaction scores. Additional recommendations are included for optimizing experimental design and analysis of smaller-scale trigenic interaction screens by using a web-based analysis system, SGAtools. This protocol provides a resource for those who would like to gain a deeper, more practical understanding of trigenic interaction screening and quantification methodology.},

  abstract = {Causal learning is a key challenge in scientific artificial intelligence as it allows researchers to go beyond purely correlative or predictive analyses towards learning underlying cause-and-effect relationships, which are important for scientific understanding as well as for a wide range of downstream tasks. Here, motivated by emerging biomedical questions, we propose a deep neural architecture for learning causal relationships between variables from a combination of high-dimensional data and prior causal knowledge. We combine convolutional and graph neural networks within a causal risk framework to provide an approach that is demonstrably effective under the conditions of high dimensionality, noise and data limitations that are characteristic of many applications, including in large-scale biology. In experiments, we find that the proposed learners can effectively identify novel causal relationships across thousands of variables. Results include extensive (linear and nonlinear) simulations (where the ground truth is known and can be directly compared against), as well as real biological examples where the models are applied to high-dimensional molecular data and their outputs compared against entirely unseen validation experiments. These results support the notion that deep learning approaches can be used to learn causal networks at large scale.},

  abstract = {Objective Ontologies are widely used in the biomedical domain. While many tools exist for the edition, alignment or evaluation of ontologies, few solutions have been proposed for ontology programming interface, i.e. for accessing and modifying an ontology within a programming language. Existing query languages (such as SPARQL) and APIs (such as OWLAPI) are not as easy-to-use as object programming languages are. Moreover, they provide few solutions to difficulties encountered with biomedical ontologies. Our objective was to design a tool for accessing easily the entities of an OWL ontology, with high-level constructs helping with biomedical ontologies. Methods From our experience on medical ontologies, we identified two difficulties: (1) many entities are represented by classes (rather than individuals), but the existing tools do not permit manipulating classes as easily as individuals, (2) ontologies rely on the open-world assumption, whereas the medical reasoning must consider only evidence-based medical knowledge as true. We designed a Python module for ontology-oriented programming. It allows access to the entities of an OWL ontology as if they were objects in the programming language. We propose a simple high-level syntax for managing classes and the associated “role-filler” constraints. We also propose an algorithm for performing local closed world reasoning in simple situations. Results We developed Owlready, a Python module for a high-level access to OWL ontologies. The paper describes the architecture and the syntax of the module version 2. It details how we integrated the OWL ontology model with the Python object model. The paper provides examples based on Gene Ontology (GO). We also demonstrate the interest of Owlready in a use case focused on the automatic comparison of the contraindications of several drugs. This use case illustrates the use of the specific syntax proposed for manipulating classes and for performing local closed world reasoning. Conclusion Owlready has been successfully used in a medical research project. It has been published as Open-Source software and then used by many other researchers. Future developments will focus on the support of vagueness and additional non-monotonic reasoning feature, and automatic dialog box generation.},

However, during this time there has not been much theoretical discussion on what constitutes a metabolism and what role it actually played in biogenesis. A critical and updated review on the topic is here offered, including some references to classical models from last century, but focusing more on current and future research. Metabolism is considered as intrinsically related to the living but not necessarily equivalent to it. More precisely, the idea of “minimal metabolism”, in contrast to previous, top-down conceptions, is formulated as a heuristic construct, halfway between chemistry and biology. Thus, rather than providing a complete or final characterization of metabolism, our aim is to encourage further investigations on it, particularly in the context of life's origin, for which some concrete methodological suggestions are provided.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Most machine learning-based methods predict outcomes rather than understanding causality. Machine learning methods have been proved to be efficient in finding correlations in data, but unskilful to determine causation. This issue severely limits the applicability of machine learning methods to infer the causal relationships between the entities of a biological network, and more in general of any dynamical system, such as medical intervention strategies and clinical outcomes system, that is representable as a network. From the perspective of those who want to use the results of network inference not only to understand the mechanisms underlying the dynamics, but also to understand how the network reacts to external stimuli (e. g. environmental factors, therapeutic treatments), tools that can understand the causal relationships between data are highly demanded. Given the increasing popularity of machine learning techniques in computational biology and the recent literature proposing the use of machine learning techniques for the inference of biological networks, we would like to present the challenges that mathematics and computer science research faces in generalising machine learning to an approach capable of understanding causal relationships, and the prospects that achieving this will open up for the medical application domains of systems biology, the main paradigm of which is precisely network biology at any physical scale.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We present an attention-based neural network module, the Set Transformer, specifically designed to model interactions among elements in the input set. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, both of which rely on attention mechanisms. In an effort to reduce computational complexity, we introduce an attention scheme inspired by inducing point methods from sparse Gaussian process literature. It reduces the computation time of self-attention from quadratic to linear in the number of elements in the set.

This paper analyses the impact of community databases on research practices in model organism biology by focusing on the history and current use of four community databases: FlyBase, Mouse Genome Informatics, WormBase and The Arabidopsis Information Resource. We discuss the standards used by the curators of these databases for what counts as reliable evidence, acceptable terminology, appropriate experimental set-ups and adequate materials (e.g., specimens). On the one hand, these choices are informed by the collaborative research ethos characterising most model organism communities. On the other hand, the deployment of these standards in databases reinforces this ethos and gives it concrete and precise instantiations by shaping the skills, practices, values and background knowledge required of the database users. We conclude that the increasing reliance on community databases as vehicles to circulate data is having a major impact on how researchers conduct and communicate their research, which affects how they understand the biology of model organisms and its relation to the biology of other species.},

Here we develop and apply a Bayesian modeling approach to resolve the temperature effects in genome scale metabolic models (GEM). The approach minimizes uncertainties in enzymatic thermal parameters and greatly improves the predictive strength of the GEMs. The resulting temperature constrained yeast GEM uncovers enzymes that limit growth at superoptimal temperatures, and squalene epoxidase (ERG1) is predicted to be the most rate limiting. By replacing this single key enzyme with an ortholog from a thermotolerant yeast strain, we obtain a thermotolerant strain that outgrows the wild type, demonstrating the critical role of sterol metabolism in yeast thermosensitivity. Therefore, apart from identifying thermal determinants of cell metabolism and enabling the design of thermotolerant strains, our Bayesian GEM approach facilitates modelling of complex biological systems in the absence of high-quality data and therefore shows promise for becoming a standard tool for genome scale modeling.},

In biomedicine and healthcare, they can represent, for example, molecular interactions, signalling pathways, disease co-morbidities or healthcare systems. In this Perspective, we posit that representation learning can realize principles of network medicine, discuss successes and current limitations of the use of representation learning on graphs in biomedicine and healthcare, and outline algorithmic strategies that leverage the topology of graphs to embed them into compact vectorial spaces. We argue that graph representation learning will keep pushing forward machine learning for biomedicine and healthcare applications, including the identification of genetic variants underlying complex traits, the disentanglement of single-cell behaviours and their effects on health, the assistance of patients in diagnosis and treatment, and the development of safe and effective medicines.},

While recent approaches use Bayesian optimization to adaptively select configurations, we focus on speeding up random search through adaptive resource allocation and early-stopping. We formulate hyperparameter optimization as a pure-exploration non-stochastic infinite-armed bandit problem where a predefined resource like iterations, data samples, or features is allocated to randomly sampled configurations. We introduce a novel algorithm, Hyperband, for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare Hyperband with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems.

Of particular interest are interactions in which a given TF regulates other TFs; these interactions define the TF regulatory networks (TRNs) that underlie cellular identity and major function. Chromatin accessibility depicts whether or not a DNA sequence is physically accessible and provides a direct measurement of transcriptional regulation. Benefiting from the accumulating chromatin accessibility data and deep learning advances, we developed a new computational method named DeepTFni to infer TRNs from the single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) data. By implementing a graph neural network, which is more suitable for network representation, DeepTFni shows outstanding performance in TRN inference, which it supports with limited numbers of cells. Furthermore, by applying DeepTFni we identified hub TFs in tissue development and tumorigenesis and revealed that many mixed-phenotype acute leukemia associated genes undergo a prominent alteration to the TRN while there is moderate difference in messenger RNA level. The DeepTFni webserver is easy to use and has provided the predicted TRNs for several popular cell lines.},

An attentive readout module is introduced to facilitate model interpretation. Extensive tests across multiple complex traits and diseases demonstrate the superior prediction performance of PRS-Net compared with a wide range of conventional PRS methods.

It has only recently been possible to extend protein structure prediction to two hundred million cataloged proteins. Characterizing the structures of the exponentially growing billions of protein sequences revealed by large scale gene sequencing experiments would necessitate a breakthrough in the speed of folding. Here we show that direct inference of structure from primary sequence using a large language model enables an order of magnitude speed-up in high resolution structure prediction. Leveraging the insight that language models learn evolutionary patterns across millions of sequences, we train models up to 15B parameters, the largest language model of proteins to date. As the language models are scaled they learn information that enables prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of individual atoms. This results in prediction that is up to 60x faster than state-of-the-art while maintaining resolution and accuracy. Building on this, we present the ESM Metagenomic Atlas. This is the first large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins, with more than 617 million structures. The atlas reveals more than 225 million high confidence predictions, including millions whose structures are novel in comparison with experimentally determined structures, giving an unprecedented view into the vast breadth and diversity of the structures of some of the least understood proteins on earth.},

While recent techniques mainly focus on standard Fourier transform and vector-valued spectral functions, they fall short in flexibility to describe specific signal distribution for each node, and expressivity of spectral function. In this paper, we present a novel wavelet-based graph convolution network, namely WaveGC, which integrates multi-resolution spectral bases and a matrix-valued filter kernel. Theoretically, we establish that WaveGC can effectively capture and decouple short-range and long-range information, providing superior filtering flexibility, surpassing existing graph convolutional networks and graph Transformers (GTs). To instantiate WaveGC, we introduce a novel technique for learning general graph wavelets by separately combining odd and even terms of Chebyshev polynomials. This approach strictly satisfies wavelet admissibility criteria. Our numerical experiments showcase the capabilities of the new network. By replacing the Transformer part in existing architectures with WaveGC, we consistently observe improvements in both short-range and long-range tasks. This underscores the effectiveness of the proposed model in handling different scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/liun-online/WaveGC.},

  abstract = {Training neural networks involves optimizing parameters to minimize a loss function, where the nature of the loss function and the optimization strategy are crucial for effective training. Hyperparameter choices, such as the learning rate in gradient descent (GD), significantly affect the success and speed of convergence. Recent studies indicate that the boundary between bounded and divergent hyperparameters can be fractal, complicating reliable hyperparameter selection. However, the nature of this fractal boundary and methods to avoid it remain unclear. In this study, we focus on GD to investigate the loss landscape properties that might lead to fractal trainability boundaries. We discovered that fractal boundaries can emerge from simple non-convex perturbations, i.e., adding or multiplying cosine type perturbations to quadratic functions. The observed fractal dimensions are influenced by factors like parameter dimension, type of non-convexity, perturbation wavelength, and perturbation amplitude. Our analysis identifies "roughness of perturbation", which measures the gradient's sensitivity to parameter changes, as the factor controlling fractal dimensions of trainability boundaries. We observed a clear transition from non-fractal to fractal trainability boundaries as roughness increases, with the critical roughness causing the perturbed loss function non-convex. Thus, we conclude that fractal trainability boundaries can arise from very simple non-convexity. We anticipate that our findings will enhance the understanding of complex behaviors during neural network training, leading to more consistent and predictable training strategies.},

ResInf learns representations of node activity dynamics and network topology without simplifying assumptions, enabling accurate resilience inference and low-dimensional visualization. Experimental results show that ResInf significantly outperforms analytical methods, with an F1-score improvement of up to 41.59\% over Gao-Barzel-Barabási framework and 14.32\% over spectral dimension reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains robust performance despite observational disturbances.

Here, we report the successful engineering of a cellulose-adherent Saccharomyces cerevisiae displaying four different synergistic cellulases on the cell surface. The cellulase-displaying yeast strain exhibited clear cell-to-cellulose adhesion and a “tearing” cellulose degradation pattern; the adhesion ability correlated with enhanced surface area and roughness of the target cellulose fibers, resulting in higher hydrolysis efficiency. The engineered yeast directly produced ethanol from rice straw despite a more than 40\% decrease in the required enzyme dosage for high-density fermentation. Thus, improved cell-to-cellulose interactions provided a novel strategy for increasing cellulose hydrolysis, suggesting a mechanism for promoting the feasibility of cellulosic biofuel production.},

  abstract = {Predicting drug efficacy and safety in vivo requires information on biological responses (e.g., cell morphology and gene expression) to small molecule perturbations. However, current molecular representation learning methods do not provide a comprehensive view of cell states under these perturbations and struggle to remove noise, hindering model generalization. We introduce the Information Alignment (InfoAlign) approach to learn molecular representations through the information bottleneck method in cells. We integrate molecules and cellular response data as nodes into a context graph, connecting them with weighted edges based on chemical, biological, and computational criteria. For each molecule in a training batch, InfoAlign optimizes the encoder's latent representation with a minimality objective to discard redundant structural information. A sufficiency objective decodes the representation to align with different feature spaces from the molecule's neighborhood in the context graph. We demonstrate that the proposed sufficiency objective for alignment is tighter than existing encoder-based contrastive methods. Empirically, we validate representations from InfoAlign in two downstream tasks: molecular property prediction against up to 19 baseline methods across four datasets, plus zero-shot molecule-morphology matching.},

We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework on a variety of use cases, from maintenance of task-specific knowledge stores, to interoperability between biomedical domains, to on-demand building of task-specific knowledge graphs for federated learning.

  abstract = {Graph level anomaly detection (GLAD) aims to spot anomalous graphs that structure pattern and feature information are different from most normal graphs in a graph set, which is rarely studied by other researchers but has significant application value. For instance, GLAD can be used to distinguish some different characteristic molecules in drug discovery and chemical analysis. However, GLAD mainly faces the following three challenges: (1) learning more comprehensive graph level representations to differ normal graphs and abnormal graphs, (2) designing an effective graph anomaly evaluation paradigm to capture graph anomalies from the local and global graph perspectives, (3) overcoming the number imbalance problem of normal and abnormal graphs. In this paper, we combine graph neural networks and contrastive learning to build an end-to-end GLAD framework for solving the three challenges above. We aim to design a new graph level anomaly evaluation way, which first utilizes the contrastive learning strategy to enhance different level representations of normal graphs from node and graph levels by a graph convolution autoencoder with perturbed graph encoder. Then, we evaluate the error of them with corresponding representations of the generated reconstruction graph to detect anomalous graphs. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets from three areas, such as molecular, protein and social network anomaly graphs, show that our model can effectively detect graph level anomaly from the majority and outperform existing advanced methods.},

GNNs often assume homophily – neighboring nodes having similar features and labels–, and therefore may not be at their full potential when dealing with non-homophilic graphs. In this work, we focus on addressing this limitation and enable Graph Attention Networks (GAT), a commonly used variant of GNNs, to explore the structural information within each graph locality. Inspired by the positional encoding in the Transformers, we propose a framework, termed Graph Attentional Networks with Positional Embeddings (GAT-POS), to enhance GATs with positional embeddings which capture structural and positional information of the nodes in the graph. In this framework, the positional embeddings are learned by a model predictive of the graph context, plugged into an enhanced GAT architecture, which is able to leverage both the positional and content information of each node. The model is trained jointly to optimize for the task of node classification as well as the task of predicting graph context. Experimental results show that GAT-POS reaches remarkable improvement compared to strong GNN baselines and recent structural embedding enhanced GNNs on non-homophilic graphs.},

  abstract = {While deep learning has achieved great success in many fields, one common criticism about deep learning is its lack of interpretability. In most cases, the hidden units in a deep neural network do not have a clear semantic meaning or correspond to any physical entities. However, model interpretability and explainability are crucial in many biomedical applications. To address this challenge, we developed the Factor Graph Neural Network model that is interpretable and predictable by combining probabilistic graphical models with deep learning. We directly encode biological knowledge such as Gene Ontology as a factor graph into the model architecture, making the model transparent and interpretable. Furthermore, we devised an attention mechanism that can capture multi-scale hierarchical interactions among biological entities such as genes and Gene Ontology terms. With parameter sharing mechanism, the unrolled Factor Graph Neural Network model can be trained with stochastic depth and generalize well. We applied our model to two cancer genomic datasets to predict target clinical variables and achieved better results than other traditional machine learning and deep learning models. Our model can also be used for gene set enrichment analysis and selecting Gene Ontology terms that are important to target clinical variables.},

Recent studies have reported that a subset of promoters, termed Epromoters, works also as enhancers to regulate distal genes. This new paradigm opened novel questions regarding the complexity of our genome and raises the possibility that genetic variation within Epromoters has pleiotropic effects on various physiological and pathological traits by differentially impacting multiple proximal and distal genes. Here, we discuss the different observations pointing to an important role of Epromoters in the regulatory landscape and summarize the evidence supporting a pleiotropic impact of these elements in disease. We further hypothesize that Epromoter might represent a major contributor to phenotypic variation and disease.},

  abstract = {Similar to managing software packages, managing the ontology life cycle involves multiple complex workflows such as preparing releases, continuous quality control checking and dependency management. To manage these processes, a diverse set of tools is required, from commandline utilities to powerful ontology-engineering environmentsr. Particularly in the biomedical domain, which has developed a set of highly diverse yet inter-dependent ontologies, standardizing release practices and metadata and establishing shared quality standards are crucial to enable interoperability. The Ontology Development Kit (ODK) provides a set of standardized, customizable and automatically executable workflows, and packages all required tooling in a single Docker image. In this paper, we provide an overview of how the ODK works, show how it is used in practice and describe how we envision it driving standardization efforts in our community.},

  abstract = {Thomas Kuhn described the progress of science as comprising occasional paradigm shifts separated by interludes of ‘normal science’. The paradigm that has held sway since the inception of molecular biology is that genes (mainly) encode proteins. In parallel, theoreticians posited that mutation is random, inferred that most of the genome in complex organisms is non-functional, and asserted that somatic information is not communicated to the germline. However, many anomalies appeared, particularly in plants and animals: the strange genetic phenomena of paramutation and transvection; introns; repetitive sequences; a complex epigenome; lack of scaling of (protein-coding) genes and increase in ‘noncoding’ sequences with developmental complexity; genetic loci termed ‘enhancers’ that control spatiotemporal gene expression patterns during development; and a plethora of ‘intergenic’, overlapping, antisense and intronic transcripts. These observations suggest that the original conception of genetic information was deficient and that most genes in complex organisms specify regulatory RNAs, some of which convey intergenerational information.

Since then, much evidence in various developmental systems has confirmed the importance of autocatalytic feedback loops combined with inhibitory interaction. Examples are found in the formation of embryonal organizing regions, in segmentation, in the polarization of individual cells, and in gene activation. By computer simulations, we have shown that the theory accounts for much of the regulatory phenomena observed, including signalling to regenerate removed parts. These self-regulatory features contribute to making development robust and error-tolerant. Furthermore, the resulting pattern is, to a large extent, independent of the details provided by initial conditions and inducing signals. BioEssays 22:753–760, 2000. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Graph pooling is a central component of a myriad of graph neural network (GNN) architectures. As an inheritance from traditional CNNs, most approaches formulate graph pooling as a cluster assignment problem, extending the idea of local patches in regular grids to graphs. Despite the wide adherence to this design choice, no work has rigorously evaluated its influence on the success of GNNs. In this paper, we build upon representative GNNs and introduce variants that challenge the need for locality-preserving representations, either using randomization or clustering on the complement graph. Strikingly, our experiments demonstrate that using these variants does not result in any decrease in performance. To understand this phenomenon, we study the interplay between convolutional layers and the subsequent pooling ones. We show that the convolutions play a leading role in the learned representations. In contrast to the common belief, local pooling is not responsible for the success of GNNs on relevant and widely-used benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Cellular functions are mediated by protein–protein interactions, and mapping the interactome provides fundamental insights into biological systems. Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry is an ideal tool for such mapping, but it has been difficult to identify low copy number complexes, membrane complexes and complexes that are disrupted by protein tagging. As a result, our current knowledge of the interactome is far from complete, and assessing the reliability of reported interactions is challenging. Here we develop a sensitive high-throughput method using highly reproducible affinity enrichment coupled to mass spectrometry combined with a quantitative two-dimensional analysis strategy to comprehensively map the interactome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Thousand-fold reduced volumes in 96-well format enabled replicate analysis of the endogenous GFP-tagged library covering the entire expressed yeast proteome1. The 4,159 pull-downs generated a highly structured network of 3,927 proteins connected by 31,004 interactions, doubling the number of proteins and tripling the number of reliable interactions compared with existing interactome maps2. This includes very-low-abundance epigenetic complexes, organellar membrane complexes and non-taggable complexes inferred by abundance correlation. This nearly saturated interactome reveals that the vast majority of yeast proteins are highly connected, with an average of 16 interactors. Similar to social networks between humans, the average shortest distance between proteins is 4.2 interactions. AlphaFold-Multimer provided novel insights into the functional roles of previously uncharacterized proteins in complexes. Our web portal (www.yeast-interactome.org) enables extensive exploration of the interactome dataset.},

One of the most significant developments is the ability to measure the transcriptome of individual cells by single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), which was pioneered in higher eukaryotes. While yeast has served as a powerful model organism in which to test and develop transcriptomic technologies, the implementation of scRNA-seq has been significantly delayed in this organism, mainly because of technical constraints associated with its intrinsic characteristics, namely the presence of a cell wall, a small cell size and little amounts of RNA. In this review, we examine the current technologies for scRNA-seq in yeast and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, we explore opportunities for developing novel technologies and the potential outcomes of implementing single-cell transcriptomics and extension to other modalities. Undoubtedly, scRNA-seq will be invaluable for both basic and applied yeast research, providing unique insights into fundamental biological processes.},

Given a distributed dynamical system with a putative hypergraph structure, an interesting question is thus how much of this hypergraph structure is actually necessary to faithfully replicate the observed dynamical behavior. To answer this question, we propose a method to determine the minimum order of a hypergraph necessary to approximate the corresponding dynamics accurately. Specifically, we develop a mathematical framework that allows us to determine this order when the type of dynamics is known. We use these ideas in conjunction with a hypergraph neural network to directly learn the dynamics itself and the resulting order of the hypergraph from both synthetic and real datasets consisting of observed system trajectories.},

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated signaling is shown to orchestrate cellular metabolism; however, it remains unclear quantitatively how the controlling circuit drives resource partition and subsequently shapes biomass growth. Here we combined experiment with mathematical modeling to dissect the signaling-mediated growth optimization of S. cerevisiae. We showed that, through cAMP-mediated control, the organism achieves maximal or nearly maximal steady-state growth during the utilization of multiple tested substrates as well as under perturbations impairing glucose uptake. However, the optimal cAMP concentration varies across cases, suggesting that different modes of resource allocation are adopted for varied conditions. Under settings with nutrient alterations, S. cerevisiae tunes its cAMP level to dynamically reprogram itself to realize rapid adaptation. Moreover, to achieve growth maximization, cells employ additional regulatory systems such as the Gcn2-mediated amino acid control. This study establishes a systematic understanding of global resource allocation in S. cerevisiae, providing insights into quantitative yeast physiology as well as metabolic strain engineering for biotechnological applications.},

  abstract = {The genome is a sequence that completely encodes the DNA, RNA, and proteins that orchestrate the function of a whole organism. Advances in machine learning combined with massive datasets of whole genomes could enable a biological foundation model that accelerates the mechanistic understanding and generative design of complex molecular interactions. We report Evo, a genomic foundation model that enables prediction and generation tasks from the molecular to genome scale. Using an architecture based on advances in deep signal processing, we scale Evo to 7 billion parameters with a context length of 131 kilobases (kb) at single-nucleotide, byte resolution. Trained on whole prokaryotic genomes, Evo can generalize across the three fundamental modalities of the central dogma of molecular biology to perform zero-shot function prediction that is competitive with, or outperforms, leading domain-specific language models. Evo also excels at multielement generation tasks, which we demonstrate by generating synthetic CRISPR-Cas molecular complexes and entire transposable systems for the first time. Using information learned over whole genomes, Evo can also predict gene essentiality at nucleotide resolution and can generate coding-rich sequences up to 650 kb in length, orders of magnitude longer than previous methods. Advances in multi-modal and multi-scale learning with Evo provides a promising path toward improving our understanding and control of biology across multiple levels of complexity.},

Although it is widely appreciated that such experiments may involve indirect effects, these frequently remain uncharacterized. Here, analysis of functionally unrelated Saccharyomyces cerevisiae deletion strains reveals a common gene expression signature. One property shared by these strains is slower growth, with increased presence of the signature in more slowly growing strains. The slow growth signature is highly similar to the environmental stress response (ESR), an expression response common to diverse environmental perturbations. Both environmental and genetic perturbations result in growth rate changes. These are accompanied by a change in the distribution of cells over different cell cycle phases. Rather than representing a direct expression response in single cells, both the slow growth signature and ESR mainly reflect a redistribution of cells over different cell cycle phases, primarily characterized by an increase in the G1 population. The findings have implications for any study of perturbation that is accompanied by growth rate changes. Strategies to counter these effects are presented and discussed.},

To optimize these industrial systems, a mathematical approach can be used to integrate the description of multiple biological networks into a single model for cell analysis and engineering. One of the most accurate models of biological systems include Expression and Thermodynamics FLux (ETFL), which efficiently integrates RNA and protein synthesis with traditional genome-scale metabolic models. However, ETFL is so far only applicable for E. coli. To adapt this model for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we developed yETFL, in which we augmented the original formulation with additional considerations for biomass composition, the compartmentalized cellular expression system, and the energetic costs of biological processes. We demonstrated the ability of yETFL to predict maximum growth rate, essential genes, and the phenotype of overflow metabolism. We envision that the presented formulation can be extended to a wide range of eukaryotic organisms to the benefit of academic and industrial research.},

We discuss genetic causation in synthetic biology and distinguish three gene concepts differing in their assumptions of genetic control. We argue that synthetic biology generally employs a difference-making approach to establishing genetic causes, and that this approach does not commit to a specific notion of genetic program or genetic control. Still, we suggest that a strong program concept of genetic material can be used as a successful heuristic in certain areas of synthetic biology. Its application requires control of causal context, and may stand in need of a modular decomposition of the target system. We relate different modularity concepts to the discussion of genetic causation and point to possible advantages of and important limitations to seeking modularity in synthetic biology systems.},

In this study, we developed a reliable high-throughput (HT) platform for yeast morphological profiling using drug-hypersensitive strains to minimize compound use, HT microscopy to speed up data generation and analysis, and a generalized linear model to predict targets with high reliability. We first conducted a proof-of-concept study using six compounds with known targets: bortezomib, hydroxyurea, methyl methanesulfonate, benomyl, tunicamycin, and echinocandin B. Then we applied our platform to predict the mechanism of action of a novel diferulate-derived compound, poacidiene. Morphological profiling of poacidiene implied that it affects the DNA damage response, which genetic analysis confirmed. Furthermore, we found that poacidiene inhibits the growth of phytopathogenic fungi, implying applications as an effective antifungal agent. Thus, our platform is a new whole-cell target prediction tool for drug discovery.},

Deletion of nearly half of the yeast genes not essential for growth affects these morphological traits. Similar morphological phenotypes are caused by deletions of functionally related genes, enabling a functional assignment of a locus to a specific cellular pathway.

We show that large language models trained on codons, instead of amino acid sequences, provide high-quality representations that outperform comparable state-of-the-art models across a variety of tasks. In some tasks, such as species recognition, prediction of protein and transcript abundance or melting point estimation, we show that a language model trained on codons outperforms every other published protein language model, including some that contain over 50 times more parameters. These results indicate that, in addition to commonly studied scale and model complexity, the information content of biological data provides an orthogonal direction to improve the power of machine learning in biology.},

Here, we describe METIS, a versatile active machine learning workflow with a simple online interface for the data-driven optimization of biological targets with minimal experiments. We demonstrate our workflow for various applications, including cell-free transcription and translation, genetic circuits, and a 27-variable synthetic CO2-fixation cycle (CETCH cycle), improving these systems between one and two orders of magnitude. For the CETCH cycle, we explore 1025 conditions with only 1,000 experiments to yield the most efficient CO2-fixation cascade described to date. Beyond optimization, our workflow also quantifies the relative importance of individual factors to the performance of a system identifying unknown interactions and bottlenecks.

  abstract = {Searching for a path between two nodes in a graph is one of the most well-studied and fundamental problems in computer science. In numerous domains such as robotics, AI, or biology, practitioners develop search heuristics to accelerate their pathfinding algorithms. However, it is a laborious and complex process to hand-design heuristics based on the problem and the structure of a given use case. Here we present PHIL (Path Heuristic with Imitation Learning), a novel neural architecture and a training algorithm for discovering graph search and navigation heuristics from data by leveraging recent advances in imitation learning and graph representation learning. At training time, we aggregate datasets of search trajectories and ground-truth shortest path distances, which we use to train a specialized graph neural network-based heuristic function using backpropagation through steps of the pathfinding process. Our heuristic function learns graph embeddings useful for inferring node distances, runs in constant time independent of graph sizes, and can be easily incorporated in an algorithm such as A\textbackslash ast  at test time. Experiments show that PHIL reduces the number of explored nodes compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets by 58.5\% on average, can be directly applied in diverse graphs ranging from biological networks to road networks, and allows for fast planning in time-critical robotics domains.},

  abstract = {Single cell transcriptional profiling opens up a new avenue in studying the functional role of cell-to-cell variability in physiological processes. The analysis of single cell expression profiles creates new challenges due to the distributive nature of the data and the stochastic dynamics of gene transcription process. The reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using single cell transcriptional profiles is particularly challenging, especially when directed gene-gene relationships are desired.We developed SINCERITIES (SINgle CEll Regularized Inference using TIme-stamped Expression profileS) for the inference of GRNs from single cell transcriptional profiles. We focused on time-stamped cross-sectional expression data, commonly generated from transcriptional profiling of single cells collected at multiple time points after cell stimulation. SINCERITIES recovers directed regulatory relationships among genes by employing regularized linear regression (ridge regression), using temporal changes in the distributions of gene expressions. Meanwhile, the modes of the gene regulations (activation and repression) come from partial correlation analyses between pairs of genes. We demonstrated the efficacy of SINCERITIES in inferring GRNs using in silico time-stamped single cell expression data and single cell transcriptional profiles of THP-1 monocytic human leukemia cells. The case studies showed that SINCERITIES could provide accurate GRN predictions, significantly better than other GRN inference algorithms such as TSNI, GENIE3 and JUMP3. Moreover, SINCERITIES has a low computational complexity and is amenable to problems of extremely large dimensionality. Finally, an application of SINCERITIES to single cell expression data of T2EC chicken erythrocytes pointed to BATF as a candidate novel regulator of erythroid development.MATLAB and R version of SINCERITIES are freely available from the following websites: http://www.cabsel.ethz.ch/tools/sincerities.html and https://github.com/CABSEL/SINCERITIES. The single cell THP-1 and T2EC transcriptional profiles are available from the original publications (Kouno et al., 2013; Richard et al., 2016). The in silico single cell data are available on SINCERITIES websites.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here we extend our previous experimental and modelling approaches to consider two possibilities. First, we have performed additional mathematical modelling to explore how the autophagy-YAP1 crosstalk may be controlled by posttranslational modifications of components of the pathways. Second, since analogous contrasting results have also been reported for autophagy as a regulator of other transduction pathways engaged in tumorigenesis (Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β/Smads, NF-kB or XIAP/cIAPs), we have considered if such discrepancies may be explicable through situations involving competing pathways and feedback loops in different cell types, analogous to the autophagy-YAP/TAZ situation. Since distinct posttranslational modifications dominate those pathways in distinct cells, these need to be understood to enable appropriate cell type-specific therapeutic strategies for cancers and other diseases.},

Here we argue that a causal perspective improves the identification of these challenges and formalizes their relation to the robustness and generalization of machine learning-based diagnostics. To make for a concrete discussion, we focus on a specific, recently established high-dimensional biomarker—adaptive immune receptor repertoires (AIRRs). Through simulations, we illustrate how major biological and experimental factors of the AIRR domain may influence the learned biomarkers. In conclusion, we argue that causal modelling improves machine learning-based biomarker robustness by identifying stable relations between variables and guiding the adjustment of the relations and variables that vary between populations.},

  abstract = {Accurate and real-time traffic passenger flows forecasting at transportation hubs, such as subway/bus stations, is a practical application and of great significance for urban traffic planning, control, guidance, etc. Recently deep learning based methods are promised to learn the spatial-temporal features from high non-linearity and complexity of traffic flows. However, it is still very challenging to handle so much complex factors including the urban transportation network topological structures and the laws of traffic flows with spatial and temporal dependencies. Considering both the static hybrid urban transportation network structures and dynamic spatial-temporal relationships among stations from historical traffic passenger flows, a more effective and fine-grained spatial-temporal features learning framework is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal incidence dynamic graph neural networks framework for urban traffic passenger flows prediction. We first model dynamic traffic station relationships over time as spatial-temporal incidence dynamic graph structures based on historically traffic passenger flows. Then we design a novel dynamic graph recurrent convolutional neural network, namely Dynamic-GRCNN, to learn the spatial-temporal features representation for urban transportation network topological structures and transportation hubs. To fully utilize the historical passenger flows, we sample the short-term, medium-term and long-term historical traffic data in training, which can capture the periodicity and trend of the traffic passenger flows at different stations. We conduct extensive experiments on different types of traffic passenger flows datasets including subway, taxi and bus flows in Beijing. The results show that the proposed Dynamic-GRCNN effectively captures comprehensive spatial-temporal correlations significantly and outperforms both traditional and deep learning based urban traffic passenger flows prediction methods.},

The possibility of constraining the adaptation of cell populations, by inhibiting proteins enhancing the evolvability, has therefore attracted interest. However, our current understanding of how genes influence adaptation kinetics is limited, partly because accurately measuring adaptation for many cell populations is challenging. We used a high-throughput adaptive laboratory evolution platform to track the adaptation of \&gt;18,000 cell populations corresponding to single-gene deletion strains in the haploid yeast deletion collection. We report that the preadaptation fitness of gene knockouts near-perfectly (R2= 0.91) predicts their adaptation to arsenic, leaving at the most a marginal role for dedicated evolvability gene functions. We tracked the adaptation of another \&gt;23,000 gene knockout populations to a diverse range of selection pressures and generalized the almost perfect (R2=0.72–0.98) capacity of preadaptation fitness to predict adaptation. We also reconstructed mutations in FPS1, ASK10, and ARR3, which together account for almost all arsenic adaptation in wild-type cells, in gene deletions covering a broad fitness range and show that the predictability of arsenic adaptation can be understood as a by global epistasis, where excluding arsenic is more beneficial to arsenic unfit cells. The paucity of genes with a meaningful evolvability effect on adaptation diminishes the prospects of developing adjuvant drugs aiming to slow antimicrobial and chemotherapy resistance.},

  abstract = {Deep learning methods predicated on convolutional neural networks and graph neural networks have enabled significant improvement in node classification and prediction when applied to graph representation with learning node embedding to effectively represent the hierarchical properties of graphs. An interesting approach (DiffPool) utilises a differentiable graph pooling technique which learns ‘differentiable soft cluster assignment’ for nodes at each layer of a deep graph neural network with nodes mapped on sets of clusters. However, effective control of the learning process is difficult given the inherent complexity in an ‘end-to-end’ model with the potential for a large number parameters (including the potential for redundant parameters). In this paper, we propose an approach termed FPool, which is a development of the basic method adopted in DiffPool (where pooling is applied directly to node representations). Techniques designed to enhance data classification have been created and evaluated using a number of popular and publicly available sensor datasets. Experimental results for FPool demonstrate improved classification and prediction performance when compared to alternative methods considered. Moreover, FPool shows a significant reduction in the training time over the basic DiffPool framework.},

This variability in cellular behaviors can be essential for a small fraction of cells to adapt and survive in various environments. Analyses at the single-cell level have allowed to highlight the great variability that is present between cells within an isogenic population. Numerous molecular mechanisms have been uncovered, allowing to understand the emergence and the role of cellular heterogeneity. These attempts at identifying the source of cellular noise have also provided clues for strategies needed to control heterogeneity. In this review, S. cerevisiae is used as an example to illustrate the different factors leading to cell heterogeneity, ranging from intracellular processes to environmental constraints.

  abstract = {Fold-switching proteins, which remodel their secondary and tertiary structures in response to cellular stimuli, suggest a new view of protein fold space. For decades, experimental evidence has indicated that protein fold space is discrete: dissimilar folds are encoded by dissimilar amino acid sequences. Challenging this assumption, fold-switching proteins interconnect discrete groups of dissimilar protein folds, making protein fold space fluid. Three recent observations support the concept of fluid fold space: (1) some amino acid sequences interconvert between folds with distinct secondary structures, (2) some naturally occurring sequences have switched folds by stepwise mutation, and (3) fold switching is evolutionarily selected and likely confers advantage. These observations indicate that minor amino acid sequence modifications can transform protein structure and function. Consequently, proteomic structural and functional diversity may be expanded by alternative splicing, small nucleotide polymorphisms, post-translational modifications, and modified translation rates.},

In terms of the stoichiometric matrix, we demonstrate both Kirchhoff's flux law ΣℓJℓ=0 over a biochemical species, and potential law Σℓμℓ=0 over a reaction loop. They reflect mass and energy conservation, respectively. For each reaction, its steady-state flux J can be decomposed into forward and backward one-way fluxes J = J+ – J, with chemical potential difference Δµ = RT ln(J–/J+). The product –JΔµ gives the isothermal heat dissipation rate, which is necessarily non-negative according to the second law of thermodynamics. The stoichiometric network theory (SNT) embodies all of the relevant fundamental physics. Knowing J and Δµ of a biochemical reaction, a conductance can be computed which directly reflects the level of gene expression for the particular enzyme. For sufficiently small flux a linear relationship between J and Δµ can be established as the linear flux–force relation in irreversible thermodynamics, analogous to Ohm's law in electrical circuits.},

Two central approaches for mapping this structure—protein fluorescent imaging and protein biophysical association—each generate extensive datasets, but of distinct qualities and resolutions that are typically treated separately2,3. Here we integrate immunofluorescence images in the Human Protein Atlas4 with affinity purifications in BioPlex5 to create a unified hierarchical map of human cell architecture. Integration is achieved by configuring each approach as a general measure of protein distance, then calibrating the two measures using machine learning. The map, known as the multi-scale integrated cell (MuSIC 1.0), resolves 69 subcellular systems, of which approximately half are to our knowledge undocumented. Accordingly, we perform 134 additional affinity purifications and validate subunit associations for the majority of systems. The map reveals a pre-ribosomal RNA processing assembly and accessory factors, which we show govern rRNA maturation, and functional roles for SRRM1 and FAM120C in chromatin and RPS3A in splicing. By integration across scales, MuSIC increases the resolution of imaging while giving protein interactions a spatial dimension, paving the way to incorporate diverse types of data in proteome-wide cell maps.},

Here, we present the Automated Recommendation Tool (ART), a tool that leverages machine learning and probabilistic modeling techniques to guide synthetic biology in a systematic fashion, without the need for a full mechanistic understanding of the biological system. Using sampling-based optimization, ART provides a set of recommended strains to be built in the next engineering cycle, alongside probabilistic predictions of their production levels. We demonstrate the capabilities of ART on simulated data sets, as well as experimental data from real metabolic engineering projects producing renewable biofuels, hoppy flavored beer without hops, fatty acids, and tryptophan. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this approach, and the practical consequences of the underlying assumptions failing.},

The computational resources and large datasets required, however, limit their applicability in biological contexts. We introduce Lyra, a subquadratic architecture for sequence modeling, grounded in the biological framework of epistasis for understanding sequence-to-function relationships. Mathematically, we demonstrate that state space models efficiently capture global epistatic interactions and combine them with projected gated convolutions for modeling local relationships. We demonstrate that Lyra is performant across over 100 wide-ranging biological tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in many key areas, including protein fitness landscape prediction, biophysical property prediction (e.g. disordered protein region functions) peptide engineering applications (e.g. antibody binding, cell-penetrating peptide prediction), RNA structure analysis, RNA function prediction, and CRISPR guide design. It achieves this with orders-of-magnitude improvements in inference speed and reduction in parameters (up to 120,000-fold in our tests) compared to recent biology foundation models. Using Lyra, we were able to train and run every task in this study on two or fewer GPUs in under two hours, democratizing access to biological sequence modeling at SOTA performance, with potential applications to many fields.},

  abstract = {We propose a recipe on how to build a general, powerful, scalable (GPS) graph Transformer with linear complexity and state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of benchmarks. Graph Transformers (GTs) have gained popularity in the field of graph representation learning with a variety of recent publications but they lack a common foundation about what constitutes a good positional or structural encoding, and what differentiates them. In this paper, we summarize the different types of encodings with a clearer definition and categorize them as being \$\textbackslash textit\{local\}\$, \$\textbackslash textit\{global\}\$ or \$\textbackslash textit\{relative\}\$. The prior GTs are constrained to small graphs with a few hundred nodes, here we propose the first architecture with a complexity linear in the number of nodes and edges \$O(N+E)\$ by decoupling the local real-edge aggregation from the fully-connected Transformer. We argue that this decoupling does not negatively affect the expressivity, with our architecture being a universal function approximator on graphs. Our GPS recipe consists of choosing 3 main ingredients: (i) positional/structural encoding, (ii) local message-passing mechanism, and (iii) global attention mechanism. We provide a modular framework \$\textbackslash textit\{GraphGPS\}\$ that supports multiple types of encodings and that provides efficiency and scalability both in small and large graphs. We test our architecture on 16 benchmarks and show highly competitive results in all of them, show-casing the empirical benefits gained by the modularity and the combination of different strategies.},

There has been some recent progress in defining the notion of pooling in graphs whereby the model tries to generate a graph level representation by downsampling and summarizing the information present in the nodes. Existing pooling methods either fail to effectively capture the graph substructure or do not easily scale to large graphs. In this work, we propose ASAP (Adaptive Structure Aware Pooling), a sparse and differentiable pooling method that addresses the limitations of previous graph pooling architectures. ASAP utilizes a novel self-attention network along with a modified GNN formulation to capture the importance of each node in a given graph. It also learns a sparse soft cluster assignment for nodes at each layer to effectively pool the subgraphs to form the pooled graph. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and theoretical analysis, we motivate our choice of the components used in ASAP. Our experimental results show that combining existing GNN architectures with ASAP leads to state-of-the-art results on multiple graph classification benchmarks. ASAP has an average improvement of 4\%, compared to current sparse hierarchical state-of-the-art method. We make the source code of ASAP available to encourage reproducible research 1.},

  abstract = {One of the exciting problems in systems biology research is to decipher how genome controls the development of complex biological system. The gene regulatory networks (GRNs) help in the identification of regulatory interactions between genes and offer fruitful information related to functional role of individual gene in a cellular system. Discovering GRNs lead to a wide range of applications, including identification of disease related pathways providing novel tentative drug targets, helps to predict disease response, and also assists in diagnosing various diseases including cancer. Reconstruction of GRNs from available biological data is still an open problem. This paper proposes a recurrent neural network (RNN) based model of GRN, hybridized with generalized extended Kalman filter for weight update in backpropagation through time training algorithm. The RNN is a complex neural network that gives a better settlement between biological closeness and mathematical flexibility to model GRN; and is also able to capture complex, non-linear and dynamic relationships among variables. Gene expression data are inherently noisy and Kalman filter performs well for estimation problem even in noisy data. Hence, we applied non-linear version of Kalman filter, known as generalized extended Kalman filter, for weight update during RNN training. The developed model has been tested on four benchmark networks such as DNA SOS repair network, IRMA network, and two synthetic networks from DREAM Challenge. We performed a comparison of our results with other state-of-the-art techniques which shows superiority of our proposed model. Further, 5\% Gaussian noise has been induced in the dataset and result of the proposed model shows negligible effect of noise on results, demonstrating the noise tolerance capability of the model.},

Recent work has provided significant insight into the first question. Detailed biochemical understanding of the mechanism and regulation of replication initiation has made possible robust hypotheses for how replication timing is regulated. Moreover, technical progress, including high-throughput, single-molecule mapping of replication initiation and single-cell assays of replication timing, has allowed for direct testing of these hypotheses in mammalian cells. This work has consolidated the conclusion that differential replication timing is a consequence of the varying probability of replication origin initiation. The second question is more difficult to directly address experimentally. Nonetheless, plausible hypotheses can be made and one—that replication timing contributes to the regulation of chromatin structure—has received new experimental support.},

In single-cell genomics (SCG), representation learning offers insights into the complex biological data, especially with emerging foundation models. However, identifying scenarios in SCG where SSL outperforms traditional learning methods remains a nuanced challenge. Furthermore, selecting the most effective pretext tasks within the SSL framework for SCG is a critical yet unresolved question. Here we address this gap by adapting and benchmarking SSL methods in SCG, including masked autoencoders with multiple masking strategies and contrastive learning methods. Models trained on over 20 million cells were examined across multiple downstream tasks, including cell-type prediction, gene-expression reconstruction, cross-modality prediction and data integration. Our empirical analyses underscore the nuanced role of SSL, namely, in transfer learning scenarios leveraging auxiliary data or analysing unseen datasets. Masked autoencoders excel over contrastive methods in SCG, diverging from computer vision trends. Moreover, our findings reveal the notable capabilities of SSL in zero-shot settings and its potential in cross-modality prediction and data integration. In summary, we study SSL methods in SCG on fully connected networks and benchmark their utility across key representation learning scenarios.},

However, the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible multigene perturbations severely limits experimental interrogation. Here, we present graph-enhanced gene activation and repression simulator (GEARS), a method that integrates deep learning with a knowledge graph of gene–gene relationships to predict transcriptional responses to both single and multigene perturbations using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from perturbational screens. GEARS is able to predict outcomes of perturbing combinations consisting of genes that were never experimentally perturbed. GEARS exhibited 40\% higher precision than existing approaches in predicting four distinct genetic interaction subtypes in a combinatorial perturbation screen and identified the strongest interactions twice as well as prior approaches. Overall, GEARS can predict phenotypically distinct effects of multigene perturbations and thus guide the design of perturbational experiments.},

  abstract = {Developing a universal representation of cells which encompasses the tremendous molecular diversity of cell types within the human body and more generally, across species, would be transformative for cell biology. Recent work using single-cell transcriptomic approaches to create molecular definitions of cell types in the form of cell atlases has provided the necessary data for such an endeavor. Here, we present the Universal Cell Embedding (UCE) foundation model. UCE was trained on a corpus of cell atlas data from human and other species in a completely self-supervised way without any data annotations. UCE offers a unified biological latent space that can represent any cell, regardless of tissue or species. This universal cell embedding captures important biological variation despite the presence of experimental noise across diverse datasets. An important aspect of UCE’s universality is that any new cell from any organism can be mapped to this embedding space with no additional data labeling, model training or fine-tuning. We applied UCE to create the Integrated Mega-scale Atlas, embedding 36 million cells, with more than 1,000 uniquely named cell types, from hundreds of experiments, dozens of tissues and eight species. We uncovered new insights about the organization of cell types and tissues within this universal cell embedding space, and leveraged it to infer function of newly discovered cell types. UCE’s embedding space exhibits emergent behavior, uncovering new biology that it was never explicitly trained for, such as identifying developmental lineages and embedding data from novel species not included in the training set. Overall, by enabling a universal representation for every cell state and type, UCE provides a valuable tool for analysis, annotation and hypothesis generation as the scale and diversity of single cell datasets continues to grow.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de-facto standard tool for modeling relational data. However, while many real-world graphs are directed, the majority of today’s GNN models discard this information altogether by simply making the graph undirected. The reasons for this are historical: 1) many early variants of spectral GNNs explicitly required undirected graphs, and 2) the first benchmarks on homophilic graphs did not find significant gain from using direction. In this paper, we show that in heterophilic settings, treating the graph as directed increases the effective homophily of the graph, suggesting a potential gain from the correct use of directionality information. To this end, we introduce Directed Graph Neural Network (Dir-GNN), a novel general framework for deep learning on directed graphs. Dir-GNN can be used to extend any Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) to account for edge directionality information by performing separate aggregations of the incoming and outgoing edges. We prove that Dir-GNN matches the expressivity of the Directed Weisfeiler-Lehman test, exceeding that of conventional MPNNs. In extensive experiments, we validate that while our framework leaves performance unchanged on homophilic datasets, it leads to large gains over base models such as GCN, GAT and GraphSage on heterophilic benchmarks, outperforming much more complex methods and achieving new state-of-the-art results.

Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is defined as heritable information passed from parents to their offspring without changing the DNA sequence. Work of the past seven decades has transitioned what was previously viewed as rare phenomenology, into well-established paradigms by which numerous traits can be modulated. For the most part, studies in model organisms have correlated transgenerational epigenetic inheritance phenotypes with changes in epigenetic modifications. The next steps for this field will entail transitioning from correlative studies to causal ones. Here, we delineate the major molecules that have been implicated in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in both mammalian and non-mammalian models, speculate on additional molecules that could be involved, and highlight some of the tools which might help transition this field from correlation to causation.},

How drugs restore these functions, however, is often unknown as a drug’s therapeutic effects are not limited to the proteins that the drug directly targets. Here, we develop the multiscale interactome, a powerful approach to explain disease treatment. We integrate disease-perturbed proteins, drug targets, and biological functions into a multiscale interactome network. We then develop a random walk-based method that captures how drug effects propagate through a hierarchy of biological functions and physical protein-protein interactions. On three key pharmacological tasks, the multiscale interactome predicts drug-disease treatment, identifies proteins and biological functions related to treatment, and predicts genes that alter a treatment’s efficacy and adverse reactions. Our results indicate that physical interactions between proteins alone cannot explain treatment since many drugs treat diseases by affecting the biological functions disrupted by the disease rather than directly targeting disease proteins or their regulators. We provide a general framework for explaining treatment, even when drugs seem unrelated to the diseases they are recommended for.},

Yet, the role of variation in recombination rate and other recombination features remains underexplored. In this review, we focus on the sensitivity of recombination rates to different extrinsic and intrinsic factors. We briefly present the empirical evidence for recombination plasticity in response to environmental perturbations and/or poor genetic background and discuss theoretical models developed to explain how such plasticity could have evolved and how it can affect important population characteristics. We highlight a gap between the evidence, which comes mostly from experiments with diploids, and theory, which typically assumes haploid selection. Finally, we formulate open questions whose solving would help to outline conditions favoring recombination plasticity. This will contribute to answering the long-standing question of why sexual recombination exists despite its costs, since plastic recombination may be evolutionary advantageous even in selection regimes rejecting any non-zero constant recombination.},

However, a systematic study of genes whose overexpression is functionally adaptive (GOFAs) under stress has yet to be conducted. We developed a new overexpression profiling method and systematically identified GOFAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under stress (heat, salt, and oxidative). Our results show that adaptive overexpression compensates for deficiencies and increases fitness under stress, like calcium under salt stress. We also investigated the impact of different genetic backgrounds on GOFAs, which varied among three S. cerevisiae strains reflecting differing calcium and potassium requirements for salt stress tolerance. Our study of a knockout collection also suggested that calcium prevents mitochondrial outbursts under salt stress. Mitochondria-enhancing GOFAs were only adaptive when adequate calcium was available and non-adaptive when calcium was deficient, supporting this idea. Our findings indicate that adaptive overexpression meets the cell’s needs for maximizing the organism’s adaptive capacity in the given environment and genetic context.},

Despite the relatively simple ellipsoidal shape of yeast cells, in the past, cell morphology researchers have processed information on cells manually. These time-consuming, entirely subjective tasks motivated us to develop image-processing software that automatically extracts yeast cells from micrographs and processes them to measure key morphological characteristics such as cell size, roundness, bud neck position angle, nuclear DNA localization and actin localization. To date, we have retrieved 960 609 cells from 52 988 micrographs of 2531 mutants using our software, and we have published the results in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Morphological Database (SCMD), which facilitates the analysis of abnormal cells. Our system provides quantitative data for shapes of the daughter and mother cells, localization of the nuclear DNA and morphology of the actin patches. To search for mutants with similar morphological traits, the system outputs a list of mutants ranked by similarity of average morphological parameters.

Instead, some directions of morphological variation are more likely than others from DNA-level variation and these largely depend on development. We argue that this evo-devo perspective should apply not only to morphology but to evolution at all phenotypic levels. At other phenotypic levels there is no development, but there are processes that can be seen, in analogy to development, as constructing the phenotype (e.g., protein folding, learning for behavior, etc.). We argue that to explain the direction of evolution two types of arguments need to be combined: generative arguments about which phenotypic variation arises in each generation and selective arguments about which of it passes to the next generation. We explain how a full consideration of the two types of arguments improves the explanatory power of evolutionary theory. Also see the video abstract here: https://youtu.be/Egbvma\_uaKc},

  abstract = {Complex networked systems often exhibit higher-order interactions, beyond dyadic interactions, which can dramatically alter their observed behavior. Consequently, understanding hypergraphs from a structural perspective has become increasingly important. Statistical, group-based inference approaches are well suited for unveiling the underlying community structure and predicting unobserved interactions. However, these approaches often rely on two key assumptions: that the same groups can explain hyperedges of any order and that interactions are assortative, meaning that edges are formed by nodes with the same group memberships. To test these assumptions, we propose a group-based generative model for hypergraphs that does not impose an assortative mechanism to explain observed higher-order interactions, unlike current approaches. Our model allows us to explore the validity of the assumptions. Our results indicate that the first assumption appears to hold true for real networks. However, the second assumption is not necessarily accurate; we find that a combination of general statistical mechanisms can explain observed hyperedges. Finally, with our approach, we are also able to determine the importance of lower and high-order interactions for predicting unobserved interactions. Our research challenges the conventional assumptions of group-based inference methodologies and broadens our understanding of the underlying structure of hypergraphs.},

When employing solid growth media, this technique is limited by being largely qualitative and low throughput. Collecting data in the form of growth curves, especially automated data collection in multi-well plates, circumvents these issues. However, the growth curves themselves are subject to stochastic variation in several variables, most notably the length of the lag phase, the doubling rate, and the maximum expansion of the culture. Thus, growth curves are indicative of trends but cannot always be conveniently averaged and statistically compared. Here, we summarize a simple method to compile growth curve data into a quantitative format that is amenable to statistical comparisons and easy to graph and display.},

The COBRA Toolbox, a MATLAB package for implementing COBRA methods, was presented earlier. Here we present a substantial update of this in silico toolbox. Version 2.0 of the COBRA Toolbox expands the scope of computations by including in silico analysis methods developed since its original release. New functions include (i) network gap filling, (ii) 13C analysis, (iii) metabolic engineering, (iv) omics-guided analysis and (v) visualization. As with the first version, the COBRA Toolbox reads and writes systems biology markup language–formatted models. In version 2.0, we improved performance, usability and the level of documentation. A suite of test scripts can now be used to learn the core functionality of the toolbox and validate results. This toolbox lowers the barrier of entry to use powerful COBRA methods.},

Here, we studied system-level epistatic interactions by computing growth phenotypes of all single and double knockouts of 890 metabolic genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using the framework of flux balance analysis4. A new scale for epistasis identified a distinctive trimodal distribution of these epistatic effects, allowing gene pairs to be classified as buffering, aggravating or noninteracting2,5. We found that the ensuing epistatic interaction network6 could be organized hierarchically into function-enriched modules that interact with each other 'monochromatically' (i.e., with purely aggravating or purely buffering epistatic links). This property extends the concept of epistasis from single genes to functional units and provides a new definition of biological modularity, which emphasizes interactions between, rather than within, functional modules. Our approach can be used to infer functional gene modules from purely phenotypic epistasis measurements.},

  abstract = {The 3’end genomic region encodes a wide range of regulatory process including mRNA stability, 3’ end processing and translation. Here, we systematically investigate the sequence determinants of 3’ end mediated expression control by measuring the effect of 13,000 designed 3’ end sequence variants on constitutive expression levels in yeast. By including a high resolution scanning mutagenesis of more than 200 native 3’ end sequences in this designed set, we found that most mutations had only a mild effect on expression, and that the vast majority (\textasciitilde 90\%) of strongly effecting mutations localized to a single positive TA-rich element, similar to a previously described 3’ end processing efficiency element, and resulted in up to ten-fold decrease in expression. Measurements of 3’ UTR lengths revealed that these mutations result in mRNAs with aberrantly long 3’UTRs, confirming the role for this element in 3’ end processing. Interestingly, we found that other sequence elements that were previously described in the literature to be part of the polyadenylation signal had a minor effect on expression. We further characterize the sequence specificities of the TA-rich element using additional synthetic 3’ end sequences and show that its activity is sensitive to single base pair mutations and strongly depends on the A/T content of the surrounding sequences. Finally, using a computational model, we show that the strength of this element in native 3’ end sequences can explain some of their measured expression variability (R = 0.41). Together, our results emphasize the importance of efficient 3’ end processing for endogenous protein levels and contribute to an improved understanding of the sequence elements involved in this process.},

To tackle the high-dimensional optimal transport problem, we introduce a deep learning method using a dimensionless formulation based on the Wasserstein–Fisher–Rao (WFR) distance. TIGON is evaluated on simulated data and compared with existing methods for its robustness and accuracy in predicting cell state transition and cell population growth. Using three scRNA-seq datasets, we show the importance of growth in the temporal inference, TIGON’s capability in reconstructing gene expression at unmeasured time points and its applications to temporal gene regulatory networks and cell–cell communication inference.},

GNN performs feature propagation by a neural network to make predictions, while LPA uses label propagation across graph adjacency matrix to get results. However, there is still no effective way to directly combine these two kinds of algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a novel Unified Message Passaging Model (UniMP) that can incorporate feature and label propagation at both training and inference time. First, UniMP adopts a Graph Transformer network, taking feature embedding and label embedding as input information for propagation. Second, to train the network without overfitting in self-loop input label information, UniMP introduces a masked label prediction strategy, in which some percentage of input label information are masked at random, and then predicted. UniMP conceptually unifies feature propagation and label propagation and is empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art semi-supervised classification results in Open Graph Benchmark (OGB).},

  abstract = {Graph neural network (GNN) and label propagation algorithm (LPA) are both message passing algorithms, which have achieved superior performance in semi-supervised classification. GNN performs feature propagation by a neural network to make predictions, while LPA uses label propagation across graph adjacency matrix to get results. However, there is still no effective way to directly combine these two kinds of algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a novel Unified Message Passaging Model (UniMP) that can incorporate feature and label propagation at both training and inference time. First, UniMP adopts a Graph Transformer network, taking feature embedding and label embedding as input information for propagation. Second, to train the network without overfitting in self-loop input label information, UniMP introduces a masked label prediction strategy, in which some percentage of input label information are masked at random, and then predicted. UniMP conceptually unifies feature propagation and label propagation and is empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art semi-supervised classification results in Open Graph Benchmark (OGB).},

  abstract = {Classic genetics studies found that genomic imbalance caused by changing the dosage of part of the genome (aneuploidy) has more detrimental effects than altering the dosage of the whole genome (ploidy). Previous analysis revealed global modulation of gene expression triggered by aneuploidy across various species, including maize (Zea mays), Arabidopsis, yeast, mammals, etc. Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 20- to 24-nt endogenous small noncoding RNAs that carry out post-transcriptional gene expression regulation. That miRNAs and their putative targets are preferentially retained as duplicates after whole-genome duplication, as are many transcription factors and signaling components, indicates miRNAs are likely to be dosage-sensitive and potentially involved in genomic balance networks. This review addresses the following questions regarding the role of miRNAs in genomic imbalance. (1) How do aneuploidy and polyploidy impact the expression of miRNAs? (2) Do miRNAs play a regulatory role in modulating the expression of their targets under genomic imbalance?},

  abstract = {Graph Transformers excel in long-range dependency modeling, but generally require quadratic memory complexity in the number of nodes in an input graph, and hence have trouble scaling to large graphs. Sparse attention variants such as Exphormer can help, but may require high-degree augmentations to the input graph for good performance, and do not attempt to sparsify an already-dense input graph. As the learned attention mechanisms tend to use few of these edges, however, such high-degree connections may be unnecessary. We show (empirically and with theoretical backing) that attention scores on graphs are usually quite consistent across network widths, and use this observation to propose a two-stage procedure, which we call Spexphormer: first, train a narrow network on the full augmented graph. Next, use only the active connections to train a wider network on a much sparser graph. We establish theoretical conditions when a narrow network's attention scores can match those of a wide network, and show that Spexphormer achieves good performance with drastically reduced memory requirements on various graph datasets.},

  abstract = {Graph transformers have emerged as a promising architecture for a variety of graph learning and representation tasks. Despite their successes, though, it remains challenging to scale graph transformers to large graphs while maintaining accuracy competitive with message-passing networks. In this paper, we introduce Exphormer, a framework for building powerful and scalable graph transformers. Exphormer consists of a sparse attention mechanism based on two mechanisms: virtual global nodes and expander graphs, whose mathematical characteristics, such as spectral expansion, pseduorandomness, and sparsity, yield graph transformers with complexity only linear in the size of the graph, while allowing us to prove desirable theoretical properties of the resulting transformer models. We show that incorporating Exphormer into the recently-proposed GraphGPS framework produces models with competitive empirical results on a wide variety of graph datasets, including state-of-the-art results on three datasets. We also show that Exphormer can scale to datasets on larger graphs than shown in previous graph transformer architectures.

In addition, the gene regulations predicted by DeepSEM on cell-type marker genes in the mouse cortex can be validated by epigenetic data, which further demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of our method.

Modern integrative taxonomy likewise depends on many lines of evidence and is increasingly complex, but the trend of collaboration lags and various attempts at ‘turbo taxonomy’ have been unsatisfactory. We are developing a taxonomic service in the Senckenberg Ocean Species Alliance to provide fundamental data for new species descriptions. This will also function as a hub to connect a global network of taxonomists, assembling an alliance of scientists working on potential new species to tackle both the extinction and inclusion crises we face today. The current rate of new species descriptions is simply too slow; the discipline is often dismissed as old fashioned, and there is a crisis level need for taxonomic descriptions to come to grips with the scale of Anthropocene biodiversity loss. Here, we envision how the process of describing and naming species would benefit from a service supporting the acquisition of descriptive data.

  abstract = {Engineering microbes to synthesize molecules of societal value has historically been a time consuming and artisanal process, with the synthesis of each new non-native molecule typically warranting its own separate publication. Because most microbial strain engineering efforts leverage a finite number of common metabolic engineering design tactics, we reasoned that automating these design steps would help create a pipeline that can quickly, cheaply, and reliably generate so-called microbial factories. In this work we describe the design and implementation of a computational system, an Automated Scientist we call Lila, which handles all metabolic engineering design and optimization through the design-build-test-learn (DBTL) paradigm. Lila generates metabolic routes, identifies relevant genetic elements for perturbation, and specifies the design and re-design of microbial strains in a matter of seconds to minutes. Strains specified by Lila are then built and subsequently phenotyped as part of a largely automated in-house pipeline. Humans remain in-the-loop to curate choices made by the system, helping for example to refine the metabolic model or suggest custom protein modifications. Lila attempted to build strains that could produce 454 biochemically diverse molecules with precursors located broadly throughout the metabolism of two microbial hosts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. Notably, we observed the highest published titers for the molecule naringenin, the metabolic precursor to flavonoids. In total we created hundreds of thousands of microbial strains capable of overproducing 242 molecules, of which 180 are not native to S. cerevisiae or E. coli.},

The workflow provides information to the user using Zenity widgets and requires minimal intervention, such as energy minimization, simulation duration, and output file naming. It initiates MD simulations within a few seconds (energy minimization, NVT, NPT, and MD) after taking input files and parameters, which takes 20–30 min in a command-line-based protocol. The single workflow also helps users to produce reproducible research results with fewer errors. The workflow is available at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/harry-maan/gmx\_qk.},

In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture, called RepSet, that can handle examples that are represented as sets of vectors. The proposed model computes the correspondences between an input set and some hidden sets by solving a series of network flow problems. This representation is then fed to a standard neural network architecture to produce the output. The architecture allows end-to-end gradient-based learning. We demonstrate RepSet on classification tasks, including text categorization, and graph classification, and we show that the proposed neural network achieves performance better or comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract = {Remotely sensed geospatial data are critical for applications including precision agriculture, urban planning, disaster monitoring and response, and climate change research, among others. Deep learning methods are particularly promising for modeling many remote sensing tasks given the success of deep neural networks in similar computer vision tasks and the sheer volume of remotely sensed imagery available. However, the variance in data collection methods and handling of geospatial metadata make the application of deep learning methodology to remotely sensed data nontrivial. For example, satellite imagery often includes additional spectral bands beyond red, green, and blue and must be joined to other geospatial data sources that can have differing coordinate systems, bounds, and resolutions. To help realize the potential of deep learning for remote sensing applications, we introduce TorchGeo, a Python library for integrating geospatial data into the PyTorch deep learning ecosystem. TorchGeo provides data loaders for a variety of benchmark datasets, composable datasets for generic geospatial data sources, samplers for geospatial data, and transforms that work with multispectral imagery. TorchGeo is also the first library to provide pre-trained models for multispectral satellite imagery (e.g., models that use all bands from the Sentinel-2 satellites), allowing for advances in transfer learning on downstream remote sensing tasks with limited labeled data. We use TorchGeo to create reproducible benchmark results on existing datasets and benchmark our proposed method for preprocessing geospatial imagery on the fly.

We performed predictions on multiple chemical libraries and discovered a molecule from the Drug Repurposing Hub—halicin—that is structurally divergent from conventional antibiotics and displays bactericidal activity against a wide phylogenetic spectrum of pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Halicin also effectively treated Clostridioides difficile and pan-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections in murine models. Additionally, from a discrete set of 23 empirically tested predictions from {$>$}107 million molecules curated from the ZINC15 database, our model identified eight antibacterial compounds that are structurally distant from known antibiotics. This work highlights the utility of deep learning approaches to expand our antibiotic arsenal through the discovery of structurally distinct antibacterial molecules.},

Folding and assembly of OMPs involves synchronized action of chaperones and multi-protein machineries which escort the highly hydrophobic polypeptides to their target outer membrane in a folding competent state. Previous studies have identified proteins and their involvement along the OMP biogenesis pathway. Yet, the mechanisms of action and the intriguing ability of all these molecular machines to work without the typical cellular energy source of ATP, but solely based on thermodynamic principles, are still not well understood. Here, we highlight how different single-molecule studies can shed additional light on the mechanisms and kinetics of OMP biogenesis.},

Different types of stresses, including thermal, mechanical, and hypoxic stresses, can alter the cellular state that accompanies changes in gene expression but not the cellular identity determined by a chromatin state that remains stable throughout life. Some tissues, such as adipose tissue, demonstrate remarkable plasticity and adaptability in response to environmental cues, enabling reversible cellular identity changes; however, the mechanisms underlying these changes are not well understood. We hypothesized that positive and/or negative “Integrators” sense environmental cues and coordinate the epigenetic and transcriptional pathways required for changes in cellular identity. Adverse environmental factors such as pollution disrupt the coordinated control contributing to disease development. Further research based on this hypothesis will reveal how organisms adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions, such as temperature, extracellular matrix stiffness, oxygen, cytokines, and hormonal cues by changing their cellular identities.},

Previous evaluations have shown pre-trained gLMs can be leveraged to improve prediction performance across a broad range of regulatory genomics tasks, albeit using relatively simple benchmark datasets and baseline models. Since the gLMs in these studies were tested upon fine-tuning their weights for each downstream task, determining whether gLM representations embody a foundational understanding of cis-regulatory biology remains an open question. Here we evaluate the representational power of pre-trained gLMs to predict and interpret cell-type-specific functional genomics data that span DNA and RNA regulation. Our findings suggest that current gLMs do not offer substantial advantages over conventional machine learning approaches that use one-hot encoded sequences. This work highlights a major limitation with current gLMs, raising potential issues in conventional pre-training strategies for the non-coding genome.},

A combination of different analytical tasks (e.g., multi-modal integration and cross-modal analysis) is required to comprehensively understand such data, inferring how gene regulation drives biological diversity and functions. However, current analytical methods are designed to perform a single task, only providing a partial picture of the multi-modal data. Here, we present UnitedNet, an explainable multi-task deep neural network capable of integrating different tasks to analyze single-cell multi-modality data. Applied to various multi-modality datasets (e.g., Patch-seq, multiome ATAC\,+\,gene expression, and spatial transcriptomics), UnitedNet demonstrates similar or better accuracy in multi-modal integration and cross-modal prediction compared with state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, by dissecting the trained UnitedNet with the explainable machine learning algorithm, we can directly quantify the relationship between gene expression and other modalities with cell-type specificity. UnitedNet is a comprehensive end-to-end framework that could be broadly applicable to single-cell multi-modality biology. This framework has the potential to facilitate the discovery of cell-type-specific regulation kinetics across transcriptomics and other modalities.},

However, it is not known whether only a select subset of genes is responsible for driving further changes. To determine whether perturbation of any given gene in a genome suffices to drive subsequent genetic changes, we analyzed the yeast knockout collection for secondary mutations of functional consequence. Unlike wild-type, most gene knockout strains were found to have one additional mutant gene affecting nutrient responses and/or heat-stress-induced cell death. Moreover, independent knockouts of the same gene often evolved mutations in the same secondary gene. Genome sequencing identified acquired mutations in several human tumor suppressor homologs. Thus, mutation of any single gene may cause a genomic imbalance, with consequences sufficient to drive adaptive genetic changes. This complicates genetic analyses but is a logical consequence of losing a functional unit originally acquired under pressure during evolution.},

Recent works pointed to the distortion of information flowing from distant nodes as a factor limiting the efficiency of message passing for tasks relying on long-distance interactions. This phenomenon, referred to as 'over-squashing', has been heuristically attributed to graph bottlenecks where the number of \$k\$-hop neighbors grows rapidly with \$k\$. We provide a precise description of the over-squashing phenomenon in GNNs and analyze how it arises from bottlenecks in the graph. For this purpose, we introduce a new edge-based combinatorial curvature and prove that negatively curved edges are responsible for the over-squashing issue. We also propose and experimentally test a curvature-based graph rewiring method to alleviate the over-squashing.},

We discuss the advances and shortcomings, differences, and concordance of the models. Of note, all of the models revealed that the uncharacterized proteins in yeast tend to be less than 200 amino acids long, contain fewer aspartates and glutamates, and are enriched for cysteine. Less than half of these proteins can be annotated with GO terms with high confidence. The distribution of the cosine similarity scores of benign and pathogenic mutations to the reference human proteins shows a statistically significant difference. The differences in embeddings of the reference TEM-1 and mutants have low to no correlation with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC).},

However, important unsupervised problems on graphs, such as graph clustering, have proved more resistant to advances in GNNs. Graph clustering has the same overall goal as node pooling in GNNs—does this mean that GNN pooling methods do a good job at clustering graphs? Surprisingly, the answer is no—current GNN pooling methods often fail to recover the cluster structure in cases where simple baselines, such as k-means applied on learned representations, work well. We investigate further by carefully designing a set of experiments to study different signal-to-noise scenarios both in graph structure and attribute data. To address these methods' poor performance in clustering, we introduce Deep Modularity Networks (DMoN), an unsupervised pooling method inspired by the modularity measure of clustering quality, and show how it tackles recovery of the challenging clustering structure of real-world graphs. Similarly, on real-world data, we show that DMoN produces high quality clusters which correlate strongly with ground truth labels, achieving state-of-the-art results with over 40\% improvement over other pooling methods across different metrics.},

  abstract = {Within clinical, biomedical, and translational science, an increasing number of projects are adopting graphs for knowledge representation. Graph-based data models elucidate the interconnectedness among core biomedical concepts, enable data structures to be easily updated, and support intuitive queries, visualizations, and inference algorithms. However, knowledge discovery across these “knowledge graphs” (KGs) has remained difficult. Data set heterogeneity and complexity; the proliferation of ad hoc data formats; poor compliance with guidelines on findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability; and, in particular, the lack of a universally accepted, open-access model for standardization across biomedical KGs has left the task of reconciling data sources to downstream consumers. Biolink Model is an open-source data model that can be used to formalize the relationships between data structures in translational science. It incorporates object-oriented classification and graph-oriented features. The core of the model is a set of hierarchical, interconnected classes (or categories) and relationships between them (or predicates) representing biomedical entities such as gene, disease, chemical, anatomic structure, and phenotype. The model provides class and edge attributes and associations that guide how entities should relate to one another. Here, we highlight the need for a standardized data model for KGs, describe Biolink Model, and compare it with other models. We demonstrate the utility of Biolink Model in various initiatives, including the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium and the Monarch Initiative, and show how it has supported easier integration and interoperability of biomedical KGs, bringing together knowledge from multiple sources and helping to realize the goals of translational science.},

  abstract = {Mutations in non-coding regulatory DNA sequences can alter gene expression, organismal phenotype and fitness1–3. Constructing complete fitness landscapes, in which DNA sequences are mapped to fitness, is a long-standing goal in biology, but has remained elusive because it is challenging to generalize reliably to vast sequence spaces4–6. Here we build sequence-to-expression models that capture fitness landscapes and use them to decipher principles of regulatory evolution. Using millions of randomly sampled promoter DNA sequences and their measured expression levels in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we learn deep neural network models that generalize with excellent prediction performance, and enable sequence design for expression engineering. Using our models, we study expression divergence under genetic drift and strong-selection weak-mutation regimes to find that regulatory evolution is rapid and subject to diminishing returns epistasis; that conflicting expression objectives in different environments constrain expression adaptation; and that stabilizing selection on gene expression leads to the moderation of regulatory complexity. We present an approach for using such~models to detect signatures of selection on expression from natural variation in regulatory sequences and use it to discover an instance of convergent regulatory evolution. We assess mutational robustness, finding that regulatory mutation effect sizes follow a power law, characterize regulatory evolvability, visualize promoter fitness landscapes, discover evolvability archetypes and illustrate the mutational robustness of natural regulatory sequence populations. Our work provides a general framework for designing regulatory~sequences and~addressing fundamental questions in regulatory evolution.},

  abstract = {Both the concept of a Darwinian tree of life (TOL) and the possibility of its accurate reconstruction have been much criticized. Criticisms mostly revolve around the extensive occurrence of lateral gene transfer (LGT), instances of uptake of complete organisms to become organelles (with the associated subsequent gene transfer to the nucleus), as well as the implications of more subtle aspects of the biological species concept. Here we argue that none of these criticisms are sufficient to abandon the valuable TOL concept and the biological realities it captures. Especially important is the need to conceptually distinguish between organismal trees and gene trees, which necessitates incorporating insights of widely occurring LGT into modern evolutionary theory. We demonstrate that all criticisms, while based on important new findings, do not invalidate the TOL. After considering the implications of these new insights, we find that the contours of evolution are best represented by a TOL.},

However, fewer than 5\% of thousands of recently discovered phosphosites have been functionally annotated. In this study, we devised a chemical genetic approach to study the functional relevance of phosphosites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We generated 474 yeast strains with mutations in specific phosphosites that were screened for fitness in 102 conditions, along with a gene deletion library. Of these phosphosites, 42\% exhibited growth phenotypes, suggesting that these are more likely functional. We inferred their function based on the similarity of their growth profiles with that of gene deletions and validated a subset by thermal proteome profiling and lipidomics. A high fraction exhibited phenotypes not seen in the corresponding gene deletion, suggestive of a gain-of-function effect. For phosphosites conserved in humans, the severity of the yeast phenotypes is indicative of their human functional relevance. This high-throughput approach allows for functionally characterizing individual phosphosites at scale.},

HYFA is genotype agnostic, supports a variable number of collected tissues per individual, and imposes strong inductive biases to leverage the shared regulatory architecture of tissues and genes. In performance comparison on Genotype–Tissue Expression project data, HYFA achieves superior performance over existing methods, especially when multiple reference tissues are available. The HYFA-imputed dataset can be used to identify replicable regulatory genetic variations (expression quantitative trait loci), with substantial gains over the original incomplete dataset. HYFA can accelerate the effective and scalable integration of tissue and cell-type transcriptome biorepositories.},

A variety of explanations have been proposed to address this major evolutionary phenomenon termed the “Cambrian explosion.” While most hypotheses address environmental, developmental, and ecological factors that facilitated evolutionary innovations, the biological basis for accelerated emergence of species diversity in the Cambrian period remains largely conjectural. Herein, we posit that morphogenesis by self-organization enables the uncoupling of genomic mutational landscape from phenotypic diversification. Evidence is provided for a two-tiered interpretation of genomic changes in metazoan animals wherein mutations not only impact upon function of individual cells, but also alter the self-organization outcome during developmental morphogenesis. We provide evidence that the morphological impacts of mutations on self-organization could remain repressed if associated with an unmet negative energetic cost. We posit that accelerated morphological diversification in transition to the Cambrian period has occurred by emergence of dormant (i.e., reserved) morphological novelties whose molecular underpinnings were seeded in the Precambrian period.},

Each sample was analyzed using RNA-sequencing, and a total of 670,446,084 uniquely mapped reads and 377,263 poly-adenylated end tags were produced. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the majority of yeast genes are expressed under one or more different conditions. By directly comparing the 5′ and 3′ ends of the transcribed regions, we find extensive differences in transcript ends across many conditions, especially those of stationary phase, growth in grape juice, and salt stimulation, suggesting differential choice of transcription start and stop sites is pervasive in yeast. Relative to the exponential growth condition (i.e., YPAD), transcripts differing at the 5′ ends and 3′ ends are predicted to differ in their annotated start codon in 21 genes and their annotated stop codon in 63 genes. Many (431) upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are found in alternate 5′ ends and are significantly enriched in transcripts produced during the salt response. Mutational analysis of five genes with uORFs revealed that two sets of uORFs increase the expression of a reporter construct, indicating a role in activation which had not been reported previously, whereas two other uORFs decreased expression. In addition, RNA binding protein motifs are statistically enriched for alternate ends under many conditions. Overall, these results demonstrate enormous diversity of transcript ends, and that this heterogeneity is regulated under different environmental conditions. Moreover, transcript end diversity has important biological implications for the regulation of gene expression. In addition, our data also serve as a valuable resource for the scientific community.},

SL-based therapy has become one of the most promising targeted cancer therapies in the last decade as PARP inhibitors achieve great success in the clinic. The key point to exploiting SL-based cancer therapy is the identification of robust SL pairs. Although many wet-lab-based methods have been developed to screen SL pairs, known SL pairs are less than 0.1\% of all potential pairs due to large number of human gene combinations. Computational prediction methods complement wet-lab-based methods to effectively reduce the search space of SL pairs. In this paper, we review the recent applications of computational methods and commonly used databases for SL prediction. First, we introduce the concept of SL and its screening methods. Second, various SL-related data resources are summarized. Then, computational methods including statistical-based methods, network-based methods, classical machine learning methods and deep learning methods for SL prediction are summarized. In particular, we elaborate on the negative sampling methods applied in these models. Next, representative tools for SL prediction are introduced. Finally, the challenges and future work for SL prediction are discussed.},

  abstract = {Single cell technologies are rapidly generating large amounts of data that enables us to understand biological systems at single-cell resolution. However, joint analysis of datasets generated by independent labs remains challenging due to a lack of consistent terminology to describe cell types. Here, we present OnClass, an algorithm and accompanying software for automatically classifying cells into cell types that are part of the controlled vocabulary that forms the Cell Ontology. A key advantage of OnClass is its capability to classify cells into cell types not present in the training data because it uses the Cell Ontology graph to infer cell type relationships. Furthermore, OnClass can be used to identify marker genes for all the cell ontology categories, regardless of whether the cell types are present or absent in the training data, suggesting that OnClass goes beyond a simple annotation tool for single cell datasets, being the first algorithm capable to identify marker genes specific to all terms of the Cell Ontology and offering the possibility of refining the Cell Ontology using a data-centric approach.},

The stable maintenance of plasmids plays a critical role in the functions and survival for microbial populations. However, predicting and controlling plasmid persistence and abundance in complex microbial communities remain challenging. Computationally, this challenge arises from the combinatorial explosion associated with the conventional modeling framework. Recently, a plasmid-centric framework (PCF) has been developed to overcome this computational bottleneck. This framework enables the derivation of a simple metric, the persistence potential, to predict plasmid persistence and abundance. Here, we discuss how PCF can be extended to account for plasmid interactions. We also discuss how such model-guided predictions of plasmid fates can benefit from the development of new experimental tools and data-driven computational methods.},

We discuss how these methods can help scientists throughout the scientific process and the central issues that remain despite such advances. Both developers and users of AI tools need a better understanding of when such approaches need improvement, and challenges posed by poor data quality and stewardship remain.

Here, we argue that interactomics needs to return to a quantitative direction because the technical achievements of the last decade have overcome the original limitations that forced its current path. In contrast to qualitative interactomics which is constrained to charting lists of observed interactions, quantitative interactomics can also uncover answers to key questions such as the strength of interactions or how many of certain complexes can form in cells, thus providing researchers with more immediate proxies for understanding and predicting biological processes.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel framework that addresses a critical limitation in Graph Self-Supervised Learning (GSSL) for graph classification: the underestimation of topological information. Traditional GSSL, despite its success in various benchmarks, often fails to fully leverage the expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly in capturing complex structural properties. This limitation stems from two main factors: (1) the inadequacy of conventional GNNs in representing sophisticated topological features, and (2) the focus of self-supervised learning solely on final graph representations. To address these issues, we introduce GenHopNet, a GNN framework that integrates a k-hop message-passing scheme, enhancing its ability to capture local structural information without explicit substructure extraction. We theoretically demonstrate that GenHopNet surpasses the expressiveness of the classical Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test for graph isomorphism. Furthermore, we propose a structural- and positional-aware GSSL framework that incorporates topological information throughout the learning process. This approach enables the learning of representations that are both sensitive to graph topology and invariant to specific structural and feature augmentations. Comprehensive experiments on graph classification datasets, including those designed to test structural sensitivity, show that our methods consistently outperform most of the existing approaches in accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Our work significantly advances GSSL's capability in distinguishing graphs with similar local structures but different global topologies.},

To test this hypothesis, we generated a chemical-genetic matrix of 195 diverse yeast deletion strains treated with 4,915 compounds. This approach uncovered 1,221 genotype-specific inhibitors, which we termed cryptagens. Synergism between 8,128 structurally disparate cryptagen pairs was assessed experimentally and used to benchmark predictive algorithms. A model based on the chemical-genetic matrix and the genetic interaction network failed to accurately predict synergism. However, a combined random forest and Naive Bayesian learner that associated chemical structural features with genotype-specific growth inhibition had strong predictive power. This approach identified previously unknown compound combinations that exhibited species-selective toxicity toward human fungal pathogens. This work demonstrates that machine learning methods trained on unbiased chemical-genetic interaction data may be widely applicable for the discovery of synergistic combinations in different species.},

  abstract = {Oversmoothing is a central challenge of building more powerful Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While previous works have only demonstrated that oversmoothing is inevitable when the number of graph convolutions tends to infinity, in this paper, we precisely characterize the mechanism behind the phenomenon via a non-asymptotic analysis. Specifically, we distinguish between two different effects when applying graph convolutions -- an undesirable mixing effect that homogenizes node representations in different classes, and a desirable denoising effect that homogenizes node representations in the same class. By quantifying these two effects on random graphs sampled from the Contextual Stochastic Block Model (CSBM), we show that oversmoothing happens once the mixing effect starts to dominate the denoising effect, and the number of layers required for this transition is \$O(\textbackslash log N/\textbackslash log (\textbackslash log N))\$ for sufficiently dense graphs with \$N\$ nodes. We also extend our analysis to study the effects of Personalized PageRank (PPR), or equivalently, the effects of initial residual connections on oversmoothing. Our results suggest that while PPR mitigates oversmoothing at deeper layers, PPR-based architectures still achieve their best performance at a shallow depth and are outperformed by the graph convolution approach on certain graphs. Finally, we support our theoretical results with numerical experiments, which further suggest that the oversmoothing phenomenon observed in practice can be magnified by the difficulty of optimizing deep GNN models.},

  abstract = {Graph neural networks are powerful architectures for structured datasets. However, current methods struggle to represent long-range dependencies. Scaling the depth or width of GNNs is insufficient to broaden receptive fields as larger GNNs encounter optimization instabilities such as vanishing gradients and representation oversmoothing, while pooling-based approaches have yet to become as universally useful as in computer vision. In this work, we propose the use of Transformer-based self-attention to learn long-range pairwise relationships, with a novel “readout” mechanism to obtain a global graph embedding. Inspired by recent computer vision results that find position-invariant attention performant in learning long-range relationships, our method, which we call GraphTrans, applies a permutation-invariant Transformer module after a standard GNN module. This simple architecture leads to state-of-the-art results on several graph classification tasks, outperforming methods that explicitly encode graph structure. Our results suggest that purely-learning-based approaches without graph structure may be suitable for learning high-level, long-range relationships on graphs. Code for GraphTrans is available at https://github.com/ucbrise/graphtrans.},

  abstract = {Inferring missing links or detecting spurious ones based on observed graphs, known as link prediction, is a long-standing challenge in graph data analysis. With the recent advances in deep learning, graph neural networks have been used for link prediction and have achieved state-of-the-art performance. Nevertheless, existing methods developed for this purpose are typically discriminative, computing features of local subgraphs around two neighboring nodes and predicting potential links between them from the perspective of subgraph classification. In this formalism, the selection of enclosing subgraphs and heuristic structural features for subgraph classification significantly affects the performance of the methods. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel and radically different link prediction algorithm based on the network reconstruction theory, called GraphLP. Instead of sampling positive and negative links and heuristically computing the features of their enclosing subgraphs, GraphLP utilizes the feature learning ability of deep-learning models to automatically extract the structural patterns of graphs for link prediction under the assumption that real-world graphs are not locally isolated. Moreover, GraphLP explores high-order connectivity patterns to utilize the hierarchical organizational structures of graphs for link prediction. Our experimental results on all common benchmark datasets from different applications demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the discriminative neural network models used for link prediction, GraphLP is generative, which provides a new paradigm for neural-network-based link prediction.},

SSL has achieved promising performance on natural language and image learning tasks. Recently, there is a trend to extend such success to graph data using graph neural networks (GNNs). In this survey, we provide a unified review of different ways of training GNNs using SSL. Specifically, we categorize SSL methods into contrastive and predictive models. In either category, we provide a unified framework for methods as well as how these methods differ in each component under the framework. Our unified treatment of SSL methods for GNNs sheds light on the similarities and differences of various methods, setting the stage for developing new methods and algorithms. We also summarize different SSL settings and the corresponding datasets used in each setting. To facilitate methodological development and empirical comparison, we develop a standardized testbed for SSL in GNNs, including implementations of common baseline methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics.},

Deep learning provides us with powerful tools to build predictive models that are appropriate for the rising amounts of data, but the gap between what these neural networks learn and what human beings can comprehend is growing. Moreover, this gap may induce distrust and restrict deep learning applications in practice. Here, we introduce a new graph neural network architecture called Attentive FP for molecular representation that uses a graph attention mechanism to learn from relevant drug discovery data sets. We demonstrate that Attentive FP achieves state-of-the-art predictive performances on a variety of data sets and that what it learns is interpretable. The feature visualization for Attentive FP suggests that it automatically learns nonlocal intramolecular interactions from specified tasks, which can help us gain chemical insights directly from data beyond human perception.},

  abstract = {Recently, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test was used to measure the expressiveness of graph neural networks (GNNs), showing that the neighborhood aggregation GNNs were at most as powerful as 1-WL test in distinguishing graph structures. There were also improvements proposed in analogy to \$k\$-WL test (\$k{$>$}1\$). However, the aggregators in these GNNs are far from injective as required by the WL test, and suffer from weak distinguishing strength, making it become expressive bottlenecks. In this paper, we improve the expressiveness by exploring powerful aggregators. We reformulate aggregation with the corresponding aggregation coefficient matrix, and then systematically analyze the requirements of the aggregation coefficient matrix for building more powerful aggregators and even injective aggregators. It can also be viewed as the strategy for preserving the rank of hidden features, and implies that basic aggregators correspond to a special case of low-rank transformations. We also show the necessity of applying nonlinear units ahead of aggregation, which is different from most aggregation-based GNNs. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop two GNN layers, ExpandingConv and CombConv. Experimental results show that our models significantly boost performance, especially for large and densely connected graphs.},

  abstract = {Recently, hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) exhibit the potential to tackle tasks with high-order correlations and have achieved success in many tasks. However, existing evolution on the hypergraph has poor controllability and lacks sufficient theoretical support (like dynamic systems), thus yielding sub-optimal performance. One typical scenario is that only one or two layers of HGNNs can achieve good results and more layers lead to degeneration of performance. Under such circumstances, it is important to increase the controllability of HGNNs. In this paper, we first introduce hypergraph dynamic systems (HDS), which bridge hypergraphs and dynamic systems and characterize the continuous dynamics of representations. We then propose a control-diffusion hypergraph dynamic system by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). We design a multi-layer HDS\$\textasciicircum\{ode\}\$ as a neural implementation, which contains control steps and diffusion steps. HDS\$\textasciicircum\{ode\}\$ has the properties of controllability and stabilization and is allowed to capture long-range correlations among vertices. Experiments on \$9\$ datasets demonstrate HDS\$\textasciicircum\{ode\}\$ beat all compared methods. HDS\$\textasciicircum\{ode\}\$ achieves stable performance with increased layers and solves the poor controllability of HGNNs. We also provide the feature visualization of the evolutionary process to demonstrate the controllability and stabilization of HDS\$\textasciicircum\{ode\}\$.},

In a typical SGA screen, a query mutation is crossed to an ordered array of approx 5000 viable gene deletion mutants (representing ∼80\% of all yeast genes) such that meiotic progeny harboring both mutations can be scored for fitness defects. This array-based approach automates yeast genetic analysis in general and can be easily adapted for a number of different screens, including genetic suppression, plasmid shuffling, dosage lethality, or suppression.},

Compressed Perturb-seq measures multiple random perturbations per cell or multiple cells per droplet and computationally decompresses these measurements by leveraging the sparse structure of regulatory circuits. Applied to 598 genes in the immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, compressed Perturb-seq achieves the same accuracy as conventional Perturb-seq with an order of magnitude cost reduction and greater power to learn genetic interactions. We identified known and novel regulators of immune responses and uncovered evolutionarily constrained genes with downstream targets enriched for immune disease heritability, including many missed by existing genome-wide association studies.

  abstract = {Studying cell metabolism serves a plethora of objectives such as the enhancement of bioprocess performance, and advancement in the understanding of cell biology, of drug target discovery, and in metabolic therapy. Remarkable successes in these fields emerged from heuristics approaches, for instance, with the introduction of effective strategies for genetic modifications, drug developments and optimization of bioprocess management. However, heuristics approaches have showed significant shortcomings, such as to describe regulation of metabolic pathways and to extrapolate experimental conditions. In the specific case of bioprocess management, such shortcomings limit their capacity to increase product quality, while maintaining desirable productivity and reproducibility levels. For instance, since heuristics approaches are not capable of prediction of the cellular functions under varying experimental conditions, they may lead to sub-optimal processes. Also, such approaches used for bioprocess control often fail in regulating a process under unexpected variations of external conditions. Therefore, methodologies inspired by the systematic mathematical formulation of cell metabolism have been used to address such drawbacks and achieve robust reproducible results. Mathematical modelling approaches are effective for both the characterization of the cell physiology, and the estimation of metabolic pathways utilization, thus allowing to characterize a cell population metabolic behavior. In this article, we present a review on methodology used and promising mathematical modelling approaches, focusing primarily to investigate metabolic events and regulation. Proceeding from a topological representation of the metabolic networks, we first present the metabolic modelling approaches that investigate cell metabolism at steady state, complying to the constraints imposed by mass conservation law and thermodynamics of reactions reversibility. Constraint-based models (CBMs) are reviewed highlighting the set of assumed optimality functions for reaction pathways. We explore models simulating cell growth dynamics, by expanding flux balance models developed at steady state. Then, discussing a change of metabolic modelling paradigm, we describe dynamic kinetic models that are based on the mathematical representation of the mechanistic description of nonlinear enzyme activities. In such approaches metabolic pathway regulations are considered explicitly as a function of the activity of other components of metabolic networks and possibly far from the metabolic steady state. We have also assessed the significance of metabolic model parameterization in kinetic models, summarizing a standard parameter estimation procedure frequently employed in kinetic metabolic modelling literature. Finally, some optimization practices used for the parameter estimation are reviewed.},

The most innovative DNA extraction techniques are silica- or magnetic-based.

Moreover, magnetic ionic liquid (MIL)-based DNA extraction has gathered attention lately, and extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA), cell-free DNA (cfDNA), and microbial community DNA are current research hotspots. These require specific extraction methods, along with constant improvements in the way they are used.

In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer.},

Although many such learning methods depend on the measurement of differences between input graphs, defining an appropriate distance metric for graphs remains a controversial issue. Hence, we propose a supervised distance metric learning method for the graph classification problem. Our method, named interpretable graph metric learning (IGML), learns discriminative metrics in a subgraph-based feature space, which has a strong graph representation capability. By introducing a sparsity-inducing penalty on the weight of each subgraph, IGML can identify a small number of important subgraphs that can provide insight into the given classification task. Because our formulation has a large number of optimization variables, an efficient algorithm that uses pruning techniques based on safe screening and working set selection methods is also proposed. An important property of IGML is that solution optimality is guaranteed because the problem is formulated as a convex problem and our pruning strategies only discard unnecessary subgraphs. Furthermore, we show that IGML is also applicable to other structured data such as itemset and sequence data, and that it can incorporate vertex-label similarity by using a transportation-based subgraph feature. We empirically evaluate the computational efficiency and classification performance of IGML on several benchmark datasets and provide some illustrative examples of how IGML identifies important subgraphs from a given graph dataset.},

To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines explicit mathematical models of cell dynamics with a machine-learning framework, implemented in TensorFlow. We tested the modeling framework on a perturbation-response dataset of a melanoma cell line after drug treatments. The models can be efficiently trained to describe cellular behavior accurately. Even though completely data driven and independent of prior knowledge, the resulting de novo network models recapitulate some known interactions. The approach is readily applicable to various kinetic models of cell biology. A record of this paper’s Transparent Peer Review process is included in the Supplemental Information.},

We consider the graph pooling as a node clustering problem, which requires the learning of a cluster assignment matrix. We propose to formulate it as a structured prediction problem and employ conditional random fields to capture the relationships among the assignments of different nodes. We also generalize our method to incorporate graph topological information in designing the Gibbs energy function. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed STRUCTPOOL.},

  abstract = {Recently, Transformer networks have redefined the state of the art in many NLP tasks. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational cost in the input sequence length \$n\$ to compute pairwise attention in each layer. This has prompted recent research into sparse Transformers that sparsify the connections in the attention layers. While empirically promising for long sequences, fundamental questions remain unanswered: Can sparse Transformers approximate any arbitrary sequence-to-sequence function, similar to their dense counterparts? How does the sparsity pattern and the sparsity level affect their performance? In this paper, we address these questions and provide a unifying framework that captures existing sparse attention models. We propose sufficient conditions under which we prove that a sparse attention model can universally approximate any sequence-to-sequence function. Surprisingly, our results show that sparse Transformers with only \$O(n)\$ connections per attention layer can approximate the same function class as the dense model with \$n\textasciicircum 2\$ connections. Lastly, we present experiments comparing different patterns/levels of sparsity on standard NLP tasks.},

  abstract = {Despite the widespread adoption of Transformer models for NLP tasks, the expressive power of these models is not well-understood. In this paper, we establish that Transformer models are universal approximators of continuous permutation equivariant sequence-to-sequence functions with compact support, which is quite surprising given the amount of shared parameters in these models. Furthermore, using positional encodings, we circumvent the restriction of permutation equivariance, and show that Transformer models can universally approximate arbitrary continuous sequence-to-sequence functions on a compact domain. Interestingly, our proof techniques clearly highlight the different roles of the self-attention and the feed-forward layers in Transformers. In particular, we prove that fixed width self-attention layers can compute contextual mappings of the input sequences, playing a key role in the universal approximation property of Transformers. Based on this insight from our analysis, we consider other simpler alternatives to self-attention layers and empirically evaluate them.},

Here, we present a strategy for genotype-phenotype reasoning based on existing knowledge of cellular subsystems. These subsystems and their hierarchical organization are defined by the Gene Ontology or a complementary ontology inferred directly from previously published datasets. Guided by the ontology’s hierarchical structure, we organize genotype data into an ‘‘ontotype,’’ that is, a hierarchy of perturbations representing the effects of genetic variation at multiple cellular scales. The ontotype is then interpreted using logical rules generated by machine learning to predict phenotype. This approach substantially outperforms previous non-hierarchical methods for translating yeast genotype to cell growth phenotype, and it accurately predicts the growth outcomes of two new screens of 2,503 double gene knockouts affecting DNA repair or nuclear lumen. Ontotypes also generalize to larger knockout combinations, setting the stage for interpreting the complex genetics of disease.},

  abstract = {One of the primary mechanisms through which a cell exerts control over its metabolic state is by modulating expression levels of its enzyme-coding genes. However, the changes at the level of enzyme expression allow only indirect control over metabolite levels, for two main reasons. First, at the level of individual reactions, metabolite levels are non-linearly dependent on enzyme abundances as per the reaction kinetics mechanisms. Secondly, specific metabolite pools are tightly interlinked with the rest of the metabolic network through their production and consumption reactions. While the role of reaction kinetics in metabolite concentration control is well studied at the level of individual reactions, the contribution of network connectivity has remained relatively unclear. Here we report a modeling framework that integrates both reaction kinetics and network connectivity constraints for describing the interplay between metabolite concentrations and mRNA levels. We used this framework to investigate correlations between the gene expression and the metabolite concentration changes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during its metabolic cycle, as well as in response to three fundamentally different biological perturbations, namely gene knockout, nutrient shock and nutrient change. While the kinetic constraints applied at the level of individual reactions were found to be poor descriptors of the mRNA-metabolite relationship, their use in the context of the network enabled us to correlate changes in the expression of enzyme-coding genes to the alterations in metabolite levels. Our results highlight the key contribution of metabolic network connectivity in mediating cellular control over metabolite levels, and have implications towards bridging the gap between genotype and metabolic phenotype.},

  abstract = {A challenge in solving the genotype-to-phenotype relationship is to predict a cell’s metabolome, believed to correlate poorly with gene expression. Using comparative quantitative proteomics, we found that differential protein expression in 97 Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinase deletion strains is non-redundant and dominated by abundance changes in metabolic enzymes. Associating differential enzyme expression landscapes to corresponding metabolomes using network models provided reasoning for poor proteome-metabolome correlations; differential protein expression redistributes flux control between many enzymes acting in concert, a mechanism not captured by one-to-one correlation statistics. Mapping these regulatory patterns using machine learning enabled the prediction of metabolite concentrations, as well as identification of candidate genes important for the regulation of metabolism. Overall, our study reveals that a large part of metabolism regulation is explained through coordinated enzyme expression changes. Our quantitative data indicate that this mechanism explains more than half of metabolism regulation and underlies the interdependency between enzyme levels and metabolism, which renders the metabolome a predictable phenotype.},

  abstract = {The design of functional materials with desired properties is essential in driving technological advances in areas like energy storage, catalysis, and carbon capture. Generative models provide a new paradigm for materials design by directly generating entirely novel materials given desired property constraints. Despite recent progress, current generative models have low success rate in proposing stable crystals, or can only satisfy a very limited set of property constraints. Here, we present MatterGen, a model that generates stable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further be fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property constraints. To enable this, we introduce a new diffusion-based generative process that produces crystalline structures by gradually refining atom types, coordinates, and the periodic lattice. We further introduce adapter modules to enable fine-tuning towards any given property constraints with a labeled dataset. Compared to prior generative models, structures produced by MatterGen are more than twice as likely to be novel and stable, and more than 15 times closer to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully generates stable, novel materials with desired chemistry, symmetry, as well as mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. Finally, we demonstrate multi-property materials design capabilities by proposing structures that have both high magnetic density and a chemical composition with low supply-chain risk. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of MatterGen's capabilities represent a major advancement towards creating a universal generative model for materials design.},

  abstract = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are being used to combat the spread of COVID-19 (refs. 1–3), but they still exhibit critical limitations caused by mRNA instability and degradation, which are major obstacles for the storage, distribution and efficacy of the vaccine products4. Increasing secondary structure lengthens mRNA half-life, which, together with optimal codons, improves protein expression5. Therefore, a principled mRNA design algorithm must optimize both structural stability and codon usage. However, owing to synonymous codons, the mRNA design space is prohibitively large—for example, there are around 2.4\,×\,10632 candidate mRNA sequences for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This poses insurmountable computational challenges. Here we provide a simple and unexpected solution using the classical concept of lattice parsing~in computational linguistics, where finding the optimal mRNA sequence is analogous to identifying the most likely sentence among similar-sounding alternatives6. Our algorithm LinearDesign finds an optimal mRNA design for the spike protein in just 11 minutes, and can concurrently optimize stability and codon usage. LinearDesign substantially improves mRNA half-life and protein expression, and~profoundly increases antibody titre by up to 128 times in mice compared to the codon-optimization benchmark on~mRNA vaccines for~COVID-19 and varicella-zoster virus. This result reveals the great potential of principled mRNA design and enables the exploration of previously unreachable but highly stable and efficient designs. Our work is a timely tool for vaccines and other mRNA-based medicines encoding therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies and anti-cancer drugs7,8.},

  abstract = {Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are fueling a new paradigm of discoveries in natural sciences. Today, AI has started to advance natural sciences by improving, accelerating, and enabling our understanding of natural phenomena at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, giving rise to a new area of research known as AI for science (AI4Science). Being an emerging research paradigm, AI4Science is unique in that it is an enormous and highly interdisciplinary area. Thus, a unified and technical treatment of this field is needed yet challenging. This work aims to provide a technically thorough account of a subarea of AI4Science; namely, AI for quantum, atomistic, and continuum systems. These areas aim at understanding the physical world from the subatomic (wavefunctions and electron density), atomic (molecules, proteins, materials, and interactions), to macro (fluids, climate, and subsurface) scales and form an important subarea of AI4Science. A unique advantage of focusing on these areas is that they largely share a common set of challenges, thereby allowing a unified and foundational treatment. A key common challenge is how to capture physics first principles, especially symmetries, in natural systems by deep learning methods. We provide an in-depth yet intuitive account of techniques to achieve equivariance to symmetry transformations. We also discuss other common technical challenges, including explainability, out-of-distribution generalization, knowledge transfer with foundation and large language models, and uncertainty quantification. To facilitate learning and education, we provide categorized lists of resources that we found to be useful. We strive to be thorough and unified and hope this initial effort may trigger more community interests and efforts to further advance AI4Science.},

  abstract = {Higher-order genetic interactions, which have profound impact on phenotypic variations, remain poorly characterized. Almost all studies to date have primarily reported pairwise interactions because it is dauntingly difficult to design high-throughput genetic screenings of the large combinatorial search space for higher-order interactions. Here, we develop an algorithm named Dango, based on a self-attention hypergraph neural network, to effectively predict the higher-order genetic interaction for a group of genes. As a proof-of-concept, we make comprehensive prediction of {$>$}400 million trigenic interactions in the yeast S. cerevisiae, significantly expanding the quantitative characterization of trigenic interactions. We find that Dango can accurately predict trigenic interactions that reveal both known and new biological functions related to cell growth. The predicted trigenic interactions can also serve as powerful genetic markers to predict growth response to many distinct conditions. Dango enables unveiling a more complete map of complex genetic interactions that impinge upon phenotypic diversity.},

  abstract = {Graph distance metric learning serves as the foundation for many graph learning problems, e.g., graph clustering, graph classification and graph matching. Existing research works on graph distance metric (or graph kernels) learning fail to maintain the basic properties of such metrics, e.g., non-negative, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry and triangle inequality, respectively. In this paper, we will introduce a new graph neural network based distance metric learning approaches, namely GB-DISTANCE (GRAPH-BERT based Neural Distance). Solely based on the attention mechanism, GB-DISTANCE can learn graph instance representations effectively based on a pre-trained GRAPH-BERT model. Different from the existing supervised/unsupervised metrics, GB-DISTANCE can be learned effectively in a semi-supervised manner. In addition, GB-DISTANCE can also maintain the distance metric basic properties mentioned above. Extensive experiments have been done on several benchmark graph datasets, and the results demonstrate that GB-DISTANCE can out-perform the existing baseline methods, especially the recent graph neural network model based graph metrics, with a significant gap in computing the graph distance.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which generalize deep neural networks to graph-structured data, have drawn considerable attention and achieved state-of-the-art performance in numerous graph related tasks. However, existing GNN models mainly focus on designing graph convolution operations. The graph pooling (or downsampling) operations, that play an important role in learning hierarchical representations, are usually overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel graph pooling operator, called Hierarchical Graph Pooling with Structure Learning (HGP-SL), which can be integrated into various graph neural network architectures. HGP-SL incorporates graph pooling and structure learning into a unified module to generate hierarchical representations of graphs. More specifically, the graph pooling operation adaptively selects a subset of nodes to form an induced subgraph for the subsequent layers. To preserve the integrity of graph's topological information, we further introduce a structure learning mechanism to learn a refined graph structure for the pooled graph at each layer. By combining HGP-SL operator with graph neural networks, we perform graph level representation learning with focus on graph classification task. Experimental results on six widely used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.},

Going beyond pairwise interactions, they encode structured relations among arbitrary numbers of units through representations such as simplicial complexes and hypergraphs. So far, the choice between simplicial complexes and hypergraphs has often been motivated by technical convenience. Here, using synchronization as an example, we demonstrate that the effects of higher-order interactions are highly representation-dependent. In particular, higher-order interactions typically enhance synchronization in hypergraphs but have the opposite effect in simplicial complexes. We provide theoretical insight by linking the synchronizability of different hypergraph structures to (generalized) degree heterogeneity and cross-order degree correlation, which in turn influence a wide range of dynamical processes from contagion to diffusion. Our findings reveal the hidden impact of higher-order representations on collective dynamics, highlighting the importance of choosing appropriate representations when studying systems with nonpairwise interactions.},

To this end, GIP advocates direct graph-level communications by introducing random inter-graph edges within standard batches. Against GIP's simplicity, we further theoretically show that GIP essentially performs a principled manifold separation via combining inter-graph message passing and GSSL, bringing about more structured embedding manifolds and thus benefits a series of downstream tasks. Our empirical study demonstrates that GIP surpasses the performance of prevailing GSSL methods across multiple benchmarks by significant margins, highlighting its potential as a breakthrough approach. Besides, GIP can be readily integrated into a series of GSSL methods and consistently offers additional performance gain.

A series of methods have been developed to map a persistence diagram to a vector representation so as to facilitate the downstream use of machine learning tools, and in these approaches, the importance (weight) of different persistence features are often preset. However often in practice, the choice of the weight function should depend on the nature of the specific type of data one considers, and it is thus highly desirable to learn a best weight function (and thus metric for persistence diagrams) from labelled data. We study this problem and develop a new weighted kernel, called WKPI, for persistence summaries, as well as an optimization framework to learn a good metric for persistence summaries. Both our kernel and optimization problem have nice properties. We further apply the learned kernel to the challenging task of graph classification, and show that our WKPI-based classification framework obtains similar or (sometimes significantly) better results than the best results from a range of previous graph classification frameworks on a collection of benchmark datasets.},

We then developed a unified statistical model that pinpoints 395 specific systems under mutational selection across 13 cancer types. This map, called NeST (Nested Systems in Tumors), incorporates canonical processes and notable discoveries, including a PIK3CA-actomyosin complex that inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling and recurrent mutations in collagen complexes that promote tumor proliferation.

  abstract = {Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from gene expression data has remained the computational challenge due to the large-scale number of genes and the complexity of expression data in systems biology, which may often formulate a reconstruction problem among nodes for a topology graph. Graph neural network (GNN) is one of the most promising approaches to reconstructing a GRN by integrating topological neighbor propagation throughout a gene network. This paper proposes an end-to-end gene regulatory directed graph neural network (GRDGNN) schema to infer GRN from scratch using gene expression data in a supervised framework. Specifically, the regulatory relationship of the GRN can be first described as a graph multi-classification problem to distinguish the connection kinds between two nodes for subgraphs. Then, using gene dominant expression features and graph embedding node features, subgraphs consisting of gene node pairs and their neighbor are classified into four classes by a directed GNN model. In addition, a starting network structure constructed with noise from partial information can guide GRN inference through an appropriate integration approach. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of this method using the test data from DREAM5 challenge and the human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and human mature hepatocytes (hHep) datasets. Computational results show that the proposed method displays greater inference performance.},

A prime example is metagenomics binning, a critical process in microbiome research that aims to group DNA sequences by their species from a complex mixture of DNA sequences derived from potentially thousands of distinct, often uncharacterized species. To fill the lack of effective DNA embedding models, we introduce DNABERT-S, a genome foundation model that specializes in creating species-aware DNA embeddings. To encourage effective embeddings to error-prone long-read DNA sequences, we introduce Manifold Instance Mixup (MI-Mix), a contrastive objective that mixes the hidden representations of DNA sequences at randomly selected layers and trains the model to recognize and differentiate these mixed proportions at the output layer. We further enhance it with the proposed Curriculum Contrastive Learning (C\$\textasciicircum 2\$LR) strategy. Empirical results on 18 diverse datasets showed DNABERT-S's remarkable performance. It outperforms the top baseline's performance in 10-shot species classification with just a 2-shot training while doubling the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) in species clustering and substantially increasing the number of correctly identified species in metagenomics binning.

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the de facto standard for representation learning on graphs, owing to their ability to effectively integrate graph topology and node attributes. However, the inherent suboptimal nature of node connections, resulting from the complex and contingent formation process of graphs, presents significant challenges in modeling them effectively. To tackle this issue, Graph Structure Learning (GSL), a family of data-centric learning approaches, has garnered substantial attention in recent years. The core concept behind GSL is to jointly optimize the graph structure and the corresponding GNN models. Despite the proposal of numerous GSL methods, the progress in this field remains unclear due to inconsistent experimental protocols, including variations in datasets, data processing techniques, and splitting strategies. In this paper, we introduce OpenGSL, the first comprehensive benchmark for GSL, aimed at addressing this gap. OpenGSL enables a fair comparison among state-of-the-art GSL methods by evaluating them across various popular datasets using uniform data processing and splitting strategies. Through extensive experiments, we observe that existing GSL methods do not consistently outperform vanilla GNN counterparts. However, we do observe that the learned graph structure demonstrates a strong generalization ability across different GNN backbones, despite its high computational and space requirements. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid and equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in the field of GSL. The code of the benchmark can be found in https://github.com/OpenGSL/OpenGSL.},

  abstract = {Graphs are widely used to describe real-world objects and their interactions. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a de facto model for analyzing graphstructured data, are highly sensitive to the quality of the given graph structures. Therefore, noisy or incomplete graphs often lead to unsatisfactory representations and prevent us from fully understanding the mechanism underlying the system. In pursuit of an optimal graph structure for downstream tasks, recent studies have sparked an effort around the central theme of Graph Structure Learning (GSL), which aims to jointly learn an optimized graph structure and corresponding graph representations. In the presented survey, we broadly review recent progress in GSL methods. Specifically, we first formulate a general pipeline of GSL and review state-of-the-art methods classified by the way of modeling graph structures, followed by applications of GSL across domains. Finally, we point out some issues in current studies and discuss future directions.},

  abstract = {We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

  abstract = {Understanding the genetic regulatory code governing gene expression is an important challenge in molecular biology. However, how individual coding and non-coding regions of the gene regulatory structure interact and contribute to mRNA expression levels remains unclear. Here we apply deep learning on over 20,000 mRNA datasets to examine the genetic regulatory code controlling mRNA abundance in 7 model organisms ranging from bacteria to Human. In all organisms, we can predict mRNA abundance directly from DNA sequence, with up to 82\% of the variation of transcript levels encoded in the gene regulatory structure. By searching for DNA regulatory motifs across the gene regulatory structure, we discover that motif interactions could explain the whole dynamic range of mRNA levels.~Co-evolution across coding and non-coding regions suggests that it is not single motifs or regions, but the entire gene regulatory structure and specific combination of regulatory elements that define gene expression levels.},
