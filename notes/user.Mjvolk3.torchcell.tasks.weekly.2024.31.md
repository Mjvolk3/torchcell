- ðŸ”² We keep having permissions issues with root
- [x] #ramble Junyu is working on Beta-Carotene.  

## 2024.07.31

- [x] Troubleshoot speed issue. â†’ it is beyond speed issues the program freezes for interaction datasets. â†’ Not all data was being serialized `publication`, I think this was messing up data transformation in the `cell_adapter`
- [x] Check that the yaml configs for fitness have publication.
- [x] Annual review. Use [[ACCESS Resource Report|dendron://torchcell/access.report.2024.05.15]]
- [x] Build interaction db

## 2024.07.30

- [x] Get biochatter working
- [x] Update `gh_neo4j.conf` so `Connect URL` is autofilled.
- [x] Respond to biocypher PR review with next steps.
- [x] Update edge and node definitions to match biolink more appropriately. â†’ `mentions` somehow not recognized but can use `is_a` and this solves it.
- [x] Document biochatter startup â†’ [[Biochatter|dendron://torchcell/database.docker.biochatter]]
- [x] Update [[torchcell.adapters.cell_adapter]] for new datasets â†’ added interactions.
- [x] Update `torchcell/biocypher/config/torchcell_schema_config.yaml` for new datasets â†’ added interactions.
- [x] Add gene essentiality to schema and clearly differentiated from current fitness. â†’ added to datasets last week [[30|dendron://torchcell/user.Mjvolk3.torchcell.tasks.weekly.2024.30]] but not documented.
- [ ] First interaction db build attempt.
