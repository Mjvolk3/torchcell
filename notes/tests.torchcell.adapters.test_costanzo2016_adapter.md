## test_no_duplicate_warnings

The idea behind this test is to provide some quality assurance on the datasets. By restricting certain types of warnings I think we are more likely to face less issues, and we will have less to debug because we will know that if there are  duplicates in the database it is due to double entry by two separate datasets. It is always easier to relax constraints later.
