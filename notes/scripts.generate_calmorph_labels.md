## 2025.08.14 - First Attempt With Open Questions

We want the structure of the data so we can add to [[torchcell.datamodels.schema]], that way schema objects are predefined prior to creating the dataset. This way schema objects can be reused for other calmorph data. I am not sure of the best way of doing this. For now we just write to python `dict` that way it can be easily imported. Not sure we should be representing so much data as code in this way... Open question.
