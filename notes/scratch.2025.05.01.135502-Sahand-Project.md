## @radivojevicMachineLearningAutomated2020: What challenges do DBTL cycles address in ART's implementation for synthetic and metabolic engineering cases?


A The DBTL cycles (Design-Build-Test-Learn) play a crucial role in ART's implementation by iteratively refining the production landscapes of metabolic engineering cases. Easy landscapes see production increases readily after the first cycle, whereas complex ones may require more than 5 cycles to show satisfactory results. Consistent improvement across 10 cycles highlights the importance of prolonged experimentation. However, only two cycles are shown to be insufficient for guaranteed convergence, indicating the necessity of further cycles for refining pathway coupling and enhancing learning processes.

## @radivojevicMachineLearningAutomated2020: How does the data scarcity and pathway-host metabolism ties affect ART's predictive power for dodecanol production?

The scarcity of data and strong ties of the pathway to host metabolism significantly compromise ART's predictive power for dodecanol production, resulting in a poor cross-validated $R^2$ value of -0.29 during cycle 1. This indicates that the initial predictions of ART were less reliable due to insufficient data and complex interactions between the metabolic pathway and the host organism.

#IDEA See if supplying extra information on metabolism helps for the dodecanol strain.
