- [ ] Get docker going again on `gh` run test sbatch
- [ ] Correct setup script so we can start fresh from `/scratch`. We deleted `wandb-experiments` but they are saved online.
- [ ] Make sure ports are getting forwarded correctly and that we can connect to the database over the network.
- [ ] 

- [ ] Try to link docker and slurm with `cgroup`
- [ ] Run build bash script for testing.
- [ ] `gh` Test build under resource constraints.
- [ ] Change logo on docs → to do this we need a `torchcell_sphinx_theme`. → cloned, changed all `pyg_spinx_theme` to `torchcell_sphinx_theme`, pushed, trying rebuild.
