## New Config Justification

Used to test that we don't get any errors when running on mac. Currently we have memory size errors that indicated overloaded memory. We also have errors associated with models, and it looks like a data shape issue.

## 2024.04.21 - Update

I believe we have fixed the issue with dataset configs since some of them were missing. We actually discovered this from [[trad]]
