## 2024.12.18

- [x] MSE and MSE like losses that won't need categorical vars. â†’  implemented `mse` and `quantile`
- [x] Read Dango again.
- [x] Run quantile regression locally.
- [ ] Run quantile regression sweep Delta.
- [ ] Information Diff. - WL Kernel
- [ ] Added genome.
- [ ] Intact and Pert GNN
- [ ] Synthesize Results in report
- [ ] Implement Dist Loss.

## Notes Related to Dango

- [ ] Verify

>>>Pearson correlation between the trigenic interaction scores of two individual replicates is around 0.59, which is much lower than the Pearson correlation between the digenic interaction score of two replicates from the same data source (0.88). ([Zhang et al., 2020, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/PJFDVT8Y)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AFBC5E89?page=3&annotation=D8D949VF))

- [ ] Plot P-Values of current dataset to compare to predicted interactions. Can do for both digenic and trigenic interactions. Do this over queried datasets.

- [ ] What is purpose of the pretraining portion? Why not just take embeddings and put into this hypergraph embedding portion?
