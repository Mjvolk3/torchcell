- [x] Clean up investigation on query 006 #M1
- [x] [[Query Issue|experiments.006-kuzmin-tmi.2025.12.08.query-issue]] - First we are checking against all deletion → Need to rebuild db for this. Using as excuse to test entire pipeline to Radiant.
- [x] Rebuild dataset with only deletions on #GH
- [ ] Notes on #GH build
- [ ] Note on chrome dangers
- [ ] Construct inference dataset locally based on genes contained in morphology and microarray data.
- [x] Transfer inference dataset to #IGB and free up GPU for inference. → optimized some.
- [ ] Inference with current best models on #GH
- [ ] Kemmeren, Sameith dataset verify metadata #M1
- [ ] Expression datasets write adapters #M1
- [x] Run test of transfer of build from #GH to #Radiant Try to streamline. → using rsync instead. This is fine for now even though we have some plans for globus.
- [ ] Start DB build over night #GH
- [ ] Model training on deletions only #IGB
